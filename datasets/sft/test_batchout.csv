"In 10 years, Cornelia will be three times as old as Kilee. If Kilee is currently 20 years old, how old is Cornelia now?","Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:

1. **Current ages:**
   - Kilee is currently 20 years old.
   - Cornelia's current age is unknown; let's denote it as \( C \).

2. **Future ages in 10 years:**
   - Kilee's age in 10 years: \( 20 + 10 = 30 \).
   - Cornelia's age in 10 years: \( C + 10 \).

3. **Given condition:**
   - In 10 years, Cornelia will be three times as old as Kilee:
     \[
     C + 10 = 3 \times 30
     \]
     \[
     C + 10 = 90
     \]
   
4. **Solve for Cornelia's current age:**
   \[
   C = 90 - 10 = 80
   \]

**Therefore, Cornelia is currently 80 years old.**

**Summary:** Cornelia is currently 80 years old.",hi
"In 6 years, Carla will be 30 years old. The sum of the current ages of Carla and Louis is 55. How old is Louis now?","Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Carla's current age:**
   - In 6 years, Carla will be 30 years old.
   - Therefore, her current age is \(30 - 6 = 24\) years.

2. **Find Louis's current age:**
   - The sum of Carla's and Louis's current ages is 55.
   - Since Carla is 24, Louis's age is \(55 - 24 = 31\).

**Final answer:**

Louis is currently **31 years old**.",hi
Winston has 14 quarters. He then spends half a dollar on candy. How many cents does he have left?,"Let's carefully analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how much money Winston has initially:**
   - Winston has 14 quarters.
   - Each quarter is worth 25 cents.
   - Total initial amount in cents: \(14 \times 25 = 350\) cents.

2. **Calculate the amount spent on candy:**
   - He spends half a dollar.
   - Half a dollar is 50 cents.

3. **Find the remaining amount after purchase:**
   - Remaining cents = initial amount - spent amount
   - \(350 - 50 = 300\) cents

**Final answer: Winston has \(\boxed{300}\) cents left.**",hi
Madeline spends 18 hours a week in class. She spends 4 hours per day working on homework. She spends 8 hours per day sleeping. She works part-time 20 hours per week. How many hours left over does Madeline have?,"Let's break down Madeline's weekly schedule step by step:

1. **Hours in class:**  
   She spends 18 hours per week in class.

2. **Hours spent on homework:**  
   She spends 4 hours per day working on homework.  
   Assuming a 7-day week:  
   4 hours/day × 7 days = 28 hours per week.

3. **Hours spent sleeping:**  
   She sleeps 8 hours per day.  
   Assuming a 7-day week:  
   8 hours/day × 7 days = 56 hours per week.

4. **Hours spent working part-time:**  
   She works 20 hours per week.

Now, let's sum up all these hours:

- Class: 18 hours  
- Homework: 28 hours  
- Sleep: 56 hours  
- Work: 20 hours

Total hours spent:  
18 + 28 + 56 + 20 = **122 hours**

Since there are 168 hours in a week (24 hours/day × 7 days), the hours remaining are:

168 - 122 = **46 hours**

**So, Madeline has 46 hours left over each week for other activities like leisure, eating, commuting, or any other tasks",hi
"Mr. Zubir bought a pair of pants, a shirt, and a coat. The pair of pants and shirt costs $100. The pants and coat cost $244. The coat costs 5 times as much as the shirt. How much did Mr. Zubir pay for his coat?","Let's carefully analyze the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- The pair of pants and shirt together cost \$100.
- The pants and coat together cost \$244.
- The coat costs 5 times as much as the shirt.

Let:
- \( P \) = cost of pants
- \( S \) = cost of shirt
- \( C \) = cost of coat

From the information:
1. \( P + S = 100 \)
2. \( P + C = 244 \)
3. \( C = 5S \)

**Step 1:** Express \( P \) from the first equation:
\[
P = 100 - S
\]

**Step 2:** Substitute \( P \) into the second equation:
\[
(100 - S) + C = 244
\]
\[
C = 244 - (100 - S) = 144 + S
\]

**Step 3:** Use the third equation \( C = 5S \):
\[
5S = 144 + S
\]
\[
5S - S = 144
\]
\[
4S = 144
\]
\[
S = \frac{144}{4} =",hi
