"When I was young, my father used to grow carnations  ----- a kind of flower which was red, pink and white. He took care of them with much love and devotion. Every day he came back home from work, he would enjoy watching them. Everyone who saw them admired them for their beauty. And he used to tell us, ""No one should touch my flowers."" One day, my younger sister Clemence, who loved dad very much, wanted to help him. So she cut the carnations from their stems  one by one and arranged them on the ground. She believed that dad would be very pleased to see them that way. When mom and I realized what my sister had done, we became completely speechless. However, my sister had no idea why no one showed her any appreciation. When my dad arrived, he went straight to see the flowers as usual. Seeing his flowers lying on the ground like dead animals, he was shocked at first. He looked towards the street to see if it was any of the neighbor's children who could have done it. Then he looked at mom in silence. Finally mom, who always taught us to tell the truth no matter what, said, ""No bad neighbors did this great job, only your lovely daughter Clemence."" Dad's face changed into a smile and then he said, ""Do I have a better flower than my lovely daughter?"" My younger sister smiled and hugged dad strongly. What caused my younger sister to smile and hug dad strongly?"
"Michele Langlois is a young Canadian who works for the police as a handwriting expert. She has helped catch many criminals by using her special skill. When she was only fourteen, Michel was already so interested in the differences in her school friends' handwriting that she would spend hours studying them. After finishing college she went to prefix = st1 /Francefor a special two-year class to learn how to analyze handwriting at theSchoolofPolice Science. On her return, she began her work for theQuebecpolice. Michele says that it is impossible for people to disguise their handwriting. She can discover most of what she needs to know simply by looking at the writing with her own eyes, but she also has machines that help her analyze different kinds of paper and ink. This knowledge is often of help to the police. Michele also believes that handwriting is a good sign of the kind of person the writer is. ""I wouldn't go out with a fellow if I didn't like his handwriting,"" she says. But she adds that she fell in love with her future husband, William Smith before she studied his handwriting. _ later proved to be all right, however. Besides helping the police Michele uses her skill to   _  ."
"Many people have long dreamed of being able to fly around as simply as riding a bicycle.  Yet the safety and strength of a flying bike was always a big problem. Over the past 10 years, developments in technology have moved the dream of personal flying vehicles closer to reality. Now, two groups of inventors say such vehicles may be available very soon. Grant Stapleton from Malloy Aeronautics says the Hoverbike, which is able to get in and out of small spaces very quickly, will be a truly personal flying vehicle.  ""It can be moved across continents very quickly because it can be folded and packed,"" he adds. Mr. Stapleton says safety was the company's main concern when developing the Hoverbike. He ays the designers solved the safety issue by using overlapping rotors     to power the vehicle.  The company is testing both a one-third size model and a full-size prototype     of the Hoverbike. Inventors say their Hoverbike will most likely be used first by the police and emergency rescue teams. In New Zealand,  the Martin Aircraft Company is also testing a full-size prototype of its personal flying bike, called Jetpack. It can fly for more than 30 minutes, up t0 1,000 meters high and reach a speed of 74 kilometers per hour. Peter Coker is the CEO of Martin Aircraft Company.  He said Jetpack ""is built around safety from the start, "" In his words, ""reliability is the most important part of it.  We have safety built into the actual structure itself, very similar to a Formula One racing car. "" Jetpack uses a gasoline-powered engine that produces two powerful jet streams.  Mr. Coker says it also has a parachute   that can be used should there be an emergency. ""It opens at a very low altitude and actually saves both the aircraft and the pilot in an emergency,"" he adds. What's the main concern the two companies share?"
"It was a quarter past nine as Marie hurried into the office building where she was going to work. Her bus had inched along through heavy morning traffic, making her a few minutes late for her very first job. She decided to start out half an hour earlier the next day   Once inside the lobby, she had to stand at the elevators and wait several minutes before she could get on one going to the sixth floor. When she finally reached the office marked ""King Enterprises"", she knocked at the door nervously and waited. There was no answer. She tapped on the door again, but still, there was no reply. From inside the next office, she could hear the sound of voices, so she opened the door and went in. Although she was sure it was the same office she had been in two weeks before when she had had the interview with Mr King, it looked quite different now. In fact, it hardly looked like an office at all. The employees were just standing around chatting and smoking. At the far end of the room, somebody must have just told a good joke, she thought, because there was a loud burst of laughter as she came in.  For a moment she had thought they were laughing at her. Then one of the men looked at his watch, clapped his hands and said something to the others. Quickly they all went to their desks and, in a matter of seconds, everyone was hard at work. No one paid any attention to Marie.  Finally she went up to the man who was sitting at the desk nearest to the door and explained that this was her first day in the office. Hardly looking up from his work, he told her to have a seat and wait for Mr King, who would arrive at any moment. Then Marie realised that the day's work in the office began just before Mr King arrived.  Later she found out that he lived in Connecticut and came into Manhattan on the same train every morning, arriving in the office at 9:35, so that his staff knew exactly when to start working. Marie could hardly recognize the office she went into as  _  ."
"Over the holidays, I took my three young children into a fancy chocolate shop to buy gifts. Halfway home, I noticed my 7-year-old son playing with a plastic noisemaker. Long story short: He had stolen the toy. I kept my cool -- even when he said, ""but it was only $1.50, Mom!"" --and explained why it was unacceptable to take things we didn't buy. A few hours later, I marched my son back to the store with two dollars from his piggy bank. He walked embarrassedly to the counter and told the clerk that he had taken something without paying for it, that he was sorry to break it and that he would pay for it now. I know exactly how terrible he was feeling. Returning to the scene of the crime is the same shame-causing punishment I received when I was five and stole something from a store. 1 remember my dad sending me back to return the item. It remains one of my clearest child- hood memories. After that day, I never stole again. My dad taught me such an important lesson 30 years ago and I saw an opportunity to do the same for my son. But now I wonder if it was the fight thing to do. ""Returning to the store is absolutely the right thing to do,"" Laura Markham, Ph.D., a child psychologist and author of Peaceful Parent, Happy Kids, says. ""Many children steal -- they' re not born knowing the rules so it' s our job to teach them."" And stay calm when you set them. ""If you overreact or yell, you might create a fascination with the behavior and a willful child will be more likely to fight against you,"" she  says. Having a child physically return the stolen item helps him or her grasp the situation -- and the consequence. But don't talk about it for too long. ""lf you continuously bring up the incident, the child will believe they' re a thief and that they' re bad,"" she says. Only time will tell if this experience will have the same powerful effect on my son as it had on me, but at the same time I can rest if I haven' t dealt with the situation badly. What does the author think of Laura Markham' s words?"
"On March 1, Computer Programs, Inc. (CP) orally agreed with Holiday Department Store (HDS) to write a set of programs for HDS's computer and to coordinate the programs with HDS's billing methods. A subsequent memo, signed by both parties, provided in its entirety: HDS will pay CP $20,000 in two equal installments within one month of completion if CP is successful in shortening by one-half the 17 processing time for the financial transactions now handled on HDS's Zenon 747 computer; CP to complete by July 1. This agreement may be amended only by a signed writing. On June 6, CP demanded $10,000, saying the job was one-half done. After HDS denied liability, the parties orally agreed that HDS should deposit $20,000 in escrow, pending completion to the satisfaction of HDS's computer systems manager. The escrow deposit was thereupon made. On July 5, CP completed the programs, having used an amount of time in which it could have earned $18,000 had it devoted that time to other jobs. Tests by CP and HDS's computer systems manager then showed that the computer programs, not being perfectly coordinated with HDS's billing methods, cut processing time by only 47 percent. They would, however, save HDS $12,000 a year. Further, if HDS would spend $5,000 to change its invoice preparation methods, as recommended by CP, the programs would cut processing time by a total of 58 percent, saving HDS another $8,000 a year. HDS's computer systems manager refused in good faith to certify satisfactory completion. HDS asked the escrow agent to return the $20,000 and asserted that nothing was owed to CP even though HDS continued to use the programs""Assume for this question only that CP was in breach of contract because of its four-day delay in completion and that an express condition precedent to HDS's duty to pay the contract 18 price has failed. Can CP nevertheless recover the reasonable value of its service?"
"What makes a gift special? Is it the price you see on the gift cover? Or is it the look on the receiver's face when they receive it that determines the true value? What gift is worth the most? This Christmas I was thinking what to give my father. My dad is a hard person to buy for because he never wants anything. I pulled out my phone to read a text message from my mom saying that we were leaving for Christmas shopping for him when I came across a message on my phone that I had locked. The message was from my father. My eyes fell on a photo of a flower taken in Wyoming, and underneath a poem by William Blake. The flower, a lone dandelion  standing against the bright blue sky, inspired me. My dad had been reciting those words to me since I was a kid. That may even be the reason why I love writing. I decided that those words would be my gift to my father. I called back. I told my mom to go without me and that I already created my gift. I sent the photo of the cream-color1ed flower to my computer and typed the poem on top of it. As I was arranging the details another poem came to mind. The poem was written by Edgar Allan Poe; my dad recited it as much as he did the other. I typed that out as well and searched online for a background to the words of it. The poem was mainly about dreaming, and after searching I found the perfect picture. The picture was painted with blues and greens and purples, twisting together to create the theme and wonder of a dream. As I watched both poems passing through the printer, the white paper color1ing with words that shaped my childhood, I felt that this was a gift that my father would truly like. Christmas soon arrived. The minute I saw the look on my dad's face as he opened those swirling black letters carefully placed in a cheap frame , I knew I had given the perfect gift.

"For years people had told our founders, motivational speakers Jack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen, inspiring stories about themselves. Jack and Mark included these stories in their talks, and their audiences repeatedly asked if they had ever been published. Eventually, Jack and Mark decided to collect the best 101 stories they'd been told and put them in a book. They called itChicken Soup for the Soulbecause they wanted it to provide comfort, just like their grandmothers' cooking. They took the book to New York, hoping to sell it to one of the big publishers, but every single one turned them down. The project appeared to have _ until they met Peter Vegso.

"Almost everyone accepts the fact that crime can never be wiped out entirely. Thus control of crime becomes the focus of police and government around the world. The question lawmakers must answer is, ""Which system of criminal punishment works best for society?"" Each country has developed its own ideas for solution to this question, and these solutions then determine how criminals are punished under different systems. However, none of the current system in use has proved 100 percent effective. There are many ideas about punishment of criminals. Some systems look only to get retribution against criminals. These systems work to frighten criminals away from repeating a crime in the future. These systems also try to deter others in society by using the criminal as an example of what can happen to a person if he or she is caught committing crimes. Rehabilitation is another philosophy by which many systems of punishment operate. The goal of these systems is to return a former criminal to society after a required period of treatment and training, usually in prisons. The idea is to help change the person's behavior so that he or she becomes a law-abiding citizen. Capital punishment is another form of punishment which systems use in extreme criminal cases, sometimes involving such crimes as a murder, rape, and violent theft. In these cases, the person is put to death. Today, capital punishment is used in relatively few countries. Many countries have done away with it. In other words, capital punishment remains only in officially law books but is rarely used. However, capital punishment remains in use in some countries including the United States. When looking at the number of crimes committed, the effectiveness of any of these forms of punishment comes into question. In the United States, for example, 80 percent of the people arrested each year are male, and the majority of these are young men or boys. One-third of all auto thefts, robberies, and burglaries are committed by young men under the age of 18. Generally, young people have less responsibility in society, so they risk losing little if they are caught in a criminal activity. However, it can also be argued that today's youthful criminals do not fear the punishment they receive if caught by police. Current methods of criminal punishment do not serve the purpose of deterring young criminals in the United States. A major problem with the current system of rehabilitation in the United Stated is that most criminals return to crime after they have supposedly been rehabilitated. Two-thirds of those caught by police each year are repeat criminals. As a result of this fact, many people feel that rehabilitation of criminals is a lost cause. Since the late 1970s, many see retribution as a preferred punishment in criminal cases in the United States. What is the main purpose behind retribution?"

"Rooster Morris is an author, entertainer, storyteller, musician, and composer. He has performed for over 4.5 million students in elementary schools, public libraries and museums. Rooster shares with the audience some of the stories in children's books. Kids walk away from his performances, believing they can write, draw, perform, sing, or play a musical instrument. Most importantly, students walk away, believing reading will open the doors to every opportunity in life. Everyone knows authors write books, but how many students actually have the opportunity to watch a published author read from their books? When a student has the advantage of meeting an author and has the opportunity to ask questions, they realize authors are people from far-away places. Rooster points out these misunderstandings and explains how he started writing. Rooster talks of habits being one of the most important things in a person's life. If people develop good habits, they will achieve their goals and be ready for anything. Rooster talks about how he wanted to play the fiddle when he was a young boy. He learns to make a habit of practicing the fundamentals. Rooster shows the kids the pay-off -- he plays a song in front of the audience and brings the excitement to a new level. Rooster will educate and entertain the audience. Many students begin writing after having seen Rooster's program. When children hear someone they admire say, ""You can do anything if you want to do it,"" it motivates them into action. Laid-Back West, Inc. has been booking authors for schools for over 13 years. We know the value of a successful author visit and can invite Rooster and other authors to visit your school. After attending Rooster Morris' performances, kids   _  ."

"There was a wonder-filled little girl who was hurt so badly that when she entered adult life, she thought she was so bad that others just couldn't be nice to her. But she had a lot of curiosity, which kept her going. She sought many wise people to help her understand why she was so bad that her mother hurt her and why she was unable to be better so that men wouldn't hurt her. She was on a journey that she thought was to help her be ""better"". She carried a big bag with her everywhere she went. Inside it were all the hurts she had experienced. Because she was so eager to please those who offered their wisdom, she willingly agreed with what they said about forgiving. But she held that bag of hurts tightly. After 50 years of carrying that bag around and showing it to all she met as if it were proof that she was a good person, she decided to open it up and just see what happened. When she looked inside it was filled with bits of paper. At one time they had words on them, detailing the hurts. But time had faded   the words and all that was left was some useless paper. She had been struggling to carry this bag that held nothing but the image of something that once was. She saw the absurdity of carrying that bag around. It made her laugh. By letting go of the paper and having pity for those that hurt her, this little girl was able to become a woman with beautiful hair. The woman looked in the mirror and said, ""I am lovable."" Although it took many years, she was finally open to bringing love and respect into her life. The woman laughed in the end because  _  ."

"It seems that great artists and scientists often suffer from mental problems. Both Einstein and Dickens had mental illness. Now scientists have started to look at whether mental illness and genius are linked . Dr. Adele Juda studied 5,000 creative people in Germany. She found there were more people with mental illness in this group than in the general population. Poets had the highest rate  of mental illness, followed by musicians, with lower numbers for painters and architects. Other scientists did research which also showed a strong link between mental problems and creativity. But, it did nothing to explain it. Dr. Ruth Richards of Harvard University _ . Instead of studying creative people, she took a group of psychiatric  patients and tested them for creativity. The patients got much higher scores than a normal group. Also, the patients' close relatives were much more creative than the patients and a normal group. This suggests that the key to the link between creativity and mental illness is in our genes . But this is a problem. According to Darwinism, harmful genes should be removed. Some scientists believe that evolution  has created a balance, where the madness of a few people leads to the development of the whole human race. Geniuses may be mad, bad or just difficult to understand, but their discoveries have improved the world we live in. It seems that a little creative madness is good for us all. What is the writer's attitude toward madness?"
"When Marco Polo travelled to Hangzhou, China 700 hundred years ago, never had he thought he'd be creating a job of social media ambassador in the 21st century in China. On May 20, one lucky foreigner would be selected to become the modern-day Marco Polo, getting a free 15-day trip to the scenic city of Hangzhou in China, and rewarded $55,000 in the next year for working part-time to promote the city to the global audience. Five finalists from Australia, Romania, U.S., Switzerland and France were in the final race. They came from a pool of 700 applicants from around the world, carefully selected by the Hangzhou Tourism Commission on their familiarity with China, social media presence and adventurous spirit. Located about 100 miles southwest to Shanghai, Hangzhou is home to 844 million population and among China's richest cities as measures by per-capita GDP. Traditionally, Hangzhou is known for its charming West Lake, a UNESCO world heritage site with traditional Chinese stories and tales, and the Grand Canal, which travels from Hangzhou to Beijing and was a key route of transportation in ancient China. The city's mild climate and charming environment drew 97 million tourists last year, contributing to 6.5% of the city's GDP. The lucky winner would start an all-expense-paid trip to Hangzhou, which, in addition to visits to tourist sites and tastings of delicious food, also would include a four-day ride along the Grand Canal and three evenings spent at a local resident's home. ""It is in fact a part-time job. How you work that out efficiently is your problem,"" Liam Bates, perhaps the strongest competitor because of his fluent Chinese, said.

"Henry Ford, the famous U.S. inventor and car manufacturer, once said, ""The business of America is business."" By this he meant that the U.S. way of life is based on the values of the business world. Few would argue with Ford's statement. A brief glimpse at a daily newspaper vividly shows how much people in the United States think about business. For example, nearly every newspaper has a business section, in which the deals and projects, finances and management, stock prices and labor problems of corporations are reported daily. In addition, business news can appear in every other section. Most national news has an important financial aspect to it. Welfare, foreign aid, the federal budget, and the policies of the Federal Reserve Bank are all heavily affected by business. Moreover, business news appears in some of the unlikeliest places. The world of arts and entertainment is often referred to as""the entertainment industry""or""show business."" The positive side of Henry Ford's statement can be seen in the prosperity that business has brought to U.S. life. One of the most important reasons so many people from all over the world come to live in the United States is the dream of a better job. Jobs are produced in abundance because the U.S. economic system is driven by competition. People believe that this system creates more wealth, more jobs, and a materially better way of life. The negative side of Henry Ford's statement, however, can be seen when the word business is taken to mean big business. And the term big business--referring to the biggest companies, is seen in opposition to labor. Throughout U.S. history working people have had to fight hard for higher wages, better working conditions, and the fight to form unions. Today, many of the old labor disputes are over, but there is still some employee anxiety. Downsizing--the laying off of thousands of workers to keep expenses low and profits high--creates feelings of insecurity for many. Henry Ford's statement can be taken negatively because   _  ."
"Tulips  are the national flower of Iran and Turkey. The European name for the flower is a misuse of the Persian word for turban , a mistake probably arising in the common Turkish custom of wearing flowers in the folds of the turban. Alternatively, the misuse may have arisen because this eastern flower, when not yet in full bloom, looks like a turban. In Persia, to give a red tulip was to declare your love for someone. The black center of the red tulip was said to represent the lover's heart, burned to a coal by love's passion. Originally growing in the Ottoman Empire (present-day Turkey), tulips were imported into Holland in the sixteenth century. When Carolus Clusius wrote the first major book on tulips in 1592, they became so popular that the tulips in his garden were stolen from time to time. As the Dutch Golden Age grew, so did this colorful flower. They were commonly seen in paintings and at festivals. In the mid-seventeenth century, tulips even created the first economics bubble , known as ""Tulip Mania"". At that time, tulips were so expensive that they were used as money until the market for them crashed. Today, Holland is still known for its tulips and other flowers, often sincerely called ""the flower shop of the world."" Tulips are planted in great fields of beautiful color, and transform the landscape into a sea of different colors. Tulip festivals are held throughout the country in spring. However, the most well-known tulip festival is organized in the Noordoostpolder, a province in the central Netherlands, each year. Held in the middle of the tulip fields, this flower festival runs from late April to early May. The Dutch people took their love of tulips abroad when they settled, and tulips and tulip festivals are now found in New York and Michigan, where the connection to their Dutch roots is still very strong. What can we learn from the text?"

"An ant was drinking at a small river and fell in. She tried her best to reach the side, but she couldn't move at all. The poor ant got too tired but was still doing her best when a big bird saw her. What a luck! The bird threw a piece of wood in the water. With it the ant reached the bank again. While she was resting and drying herself in the grass, she heard a man coming up. He was walking without shoes on his feet and with a gun in his hand.

"I wish there would be a way to describe China in simple terms but that's impossible. For the most part Chinese people are friendly, easy-going and optimistic. They are curious and unusually patient and they are also the hardest-working people I have ever met. In China, family is everything. In my English classes when the students were asked what they would do if they only had a few hours to live, most students told me how they would spend their last few hours with their families and parents. Many times the subjects in the classes center on families and friends. I teach many students a year, talking to them freely. The cost of living here is very low compared with that of the US. The city of Xiang Fan I live in isn't large and I live better. Non-imported  foods are very cheap, so are clothing and articles of everyday use. The cost of public transportation is very low, too. Chinese value education. However, it is reported that many children can't afford the expenses of schooling and are forced to leave school in some poor area in China. But they organized Project Hope many years age. It creates conditions for the poor children to go back to school. In my opinion, Project Hope is of great importance to the development of the rural education. When we read news of China in the west, rarely, if ever, will we see anything mentioned of the positive changes China has gone through. While it is true that economic miracles have not reached many areas of China, but we also have the same problems. When I am asked which country I consider better. China or the US, my answer has always been the same, ""We are not worse or better than each other, we are only different."" We can infer from the passage that the author thinks  _  ."

"High school graduation--the bittersweet feelings are as much a part of me now as they were twenty-one years ago. As graduation day approached, excitement increased. Being out of high school meant I was finally coming of age. Soon I would be on my own, making my own decisions, doing what I wanted without someone looking over my shoulder and it meant going to school with boys--a welcome change coming from an all-girl high school. There was never any question in my mind that I would go to a college away from home. My mother's idea, on the other hand, was just the opposite. Trying her best not to force her preferences on me, she would subtly ask whether I had considered particular schools--all of which happened to be located in or near my hometown of Chicago. Once it was established that, as long as the expenses would not be too heavy a burden on the family budget, I would be going away anyway, my family's perspective changed. Their concern shifted from whether I was going away to how far. The schools I was considering on the East Coast suddenly looked much more attractive than those in California. But which college I would attend was just one of what seemed like a never-ending list of unknowns: What would college be like? Would I be unbearably lonely not knowing anyone else who was going to the same school? Would the other students like me? Would I make friends easily? Would I miss my family so much that I wouldn't be able to stand it? And what about the work--would I be able to keep up? (Being an A student in high school seemed to offer little assurance I would be able to survive college.) What if the college I selected turned out to be a horrible mistake? Would I be able to transfer to another school? Then panic set in. My feelings took a 180-degree turn. I really didn't want to leave high school at all, and it was questionable whether I wanted to grow up after all. It had been nice being respected as a senior by the underclass students for the past year; I didn't enjoy the idea of being on the bottom rung of the ladder again. Despite months of expectation, nothing could have prepared me for the impact of the actual day. As the familiar melody of ""Pomp and Circumstance"" echoed in the background, I looked around at the other figures in white caps and gowns as we seriously lined into the hall. Tears welled up uncontrollably in my eyes, and I was consumed by a rush of sadness. As if in a daze , I rose from my seat when I heard my name called and slowly crossed the stage to receive my diploma. As I reached out my hand, I knew that I was reaching not just for a piece of paper but for a brand-new life. Exciting as the future of a new life seemed, it wasn't easy saying good-bye to the old one--the familiar faces, the familiar routine. I would even miss that chemistry class I wasn't particularly fond of and the long travel each day between home and school that I hated. Good or bad, it was what I knew. That September, I was fortunate to attend a wonderful university in Providence, Rhode Island. I needn't have worried about liking it. My years there turned out to be some of the best years of my life. And as for friends, some of the friendships I formed there I still treasure today. Years later, financial difficulties forced my high school to close its doors for good. Although going back is impossible, it's comforting to know I can revisit my special memories any time. Expectation and excitement suddenly changed into anxiety and fear. Which of the following did the author NOT include as a reason for that change?"
"The cost of raising a child from birth to age 18 is about $ 160,140! That doesn't even touch college tuition. For those with kids, this figure might lead them thinking how much they could have banked. For others, that number might confirmthe decision to remain childless. But $ 160,140 isn't so bad if you break it down. It translates into $ 8 ,896. 66 a year, $ 741. 38 a month, or $171. 08 a week. That's a mere $24. 44 a day! Just over a dollar an hour. Still, you might think the best financial advice says don't have children if you ever want to be ""rich"". It is not. What do you get for your $ 160,140? *         Naming rights. *         Giggles under the covers every night. *         More love than your heart can hold. *         Kisses and hugs. *         Endless wonder over rocks, ants, clouds, and warm cookies. *         A hand to hold usually covered with jam. *         A partner for blowing bubbles, flying kites, and building sandeastles. For $ 160,140, you never have to grow up! You get to finger-paint, carve pumpkins, play hide-and-seek, and never stop believing in Santa Claus. You have an excuse to keep reading the Adventures of Piglet and Pooh, watching cartoons , going to Disney movies, and wishing on stars. For $ 160,140, you get to be a hero just for taking the training wheels off the bike, and coaching a baseball team that never wins but always gets treated to ice cream regardless. You get a front row seat to history; to witness the first step, first word, first date, and first time behind the wheel. You get to be immortal  You get another branch added to your family tree. You get an education in nursing, criminal justice and communications that no college can match. In the eyes of a child, you rank right up there with God. You have all the power to correct a mistake, scare away the monsters under the bed, patch a broken heart, police a party, and love them without limits, so one day they will, like you, love without counting the cost. ...... Which of the following could be used as the last sentence to end the passage?"
"Americans are proud of their variety and individuality,yet they love and respect few things more than a uniform,whether it is the uniform of an elevator operator or the uniform of a fivestar general. Why are uniforms so popular in the United States? Among the arguments for uniforms,one of the first is that in the eyes of most people they look more professional than civilian clothes. People have become conditioned to expect superior quality from a man who wears a uniform. The television repairman who wears a uniform tends to inspire more trust than one who appears in civilian clothes. Faith in the skill of a garage mechanic  is increased by a uniform. What easier way is there for a nurse,a policeman,a barber,or a waiter to lose professional identity than to step out of uniform? Uniforms also have many practical benefits. They save on other clothes. They save on laundry bills. They are taxdeductible .They are often more comfortable and more durable than civilian clothes. Primary  among the arguments against uniforms is their lack of variety and the consequent loss of individuality experienced by people who must wear them. Though there are many types of uniforms,the wearer of any particular type is generally stuck with it,without change,until retirement. When people look alike,they tend to think,speak,and act similarly,on the job at least. Uniforms also give rise to some practical problems. Though they are longlasting,often their initial expense is greater than the cost of civilian clothes. Some uniforms are also expensive to maintain(,),requiring professional dry cleaning rather than the home laundering  possible with many types of civilian clothes. It is surprising that Americans who worship variety and individuality  _  ."
"ohn Cruitt, 62, spent decades tracking down his third- grade teacher. He wanted to talk with Cecile Doyle about 1958--- the year his mother, who was seriously ill, passed away. Her death came just days before Christmas. Cruitt had been expecting to go home from school and decorate the Christmas tree. ""When I found out she died, I could certainly relate to that, because when I was 11, my own father died,"" Doyle tells Cruitt at StoryCorps in Monroe, N.Y. ""And you just don't know how you're going to go on without that person."" When Cruitt returned to school, Doyle waited until all of the other children left the room at the end of the day, and told him that she was there if he needed her. ""Then you kissed me on the head,"" Cruitt says. ""And I felt that things really would be OK."" ""Well, Cruitt, I'm so glad that I could be there with you for that time,"" says Doyle, 82. Decades after his mother's death, Cruitt began to think more and more of Doyle. He finally wrote a letter: Dear Mrs. Doyle, If you are not the Cecile Doyle who taught English at Emerson School in Kearny, N.J., then I'm embarrassed, and you can disregard the letter. My name is John Cruitt, and I was in your third- grade class during the 1958-1959 school year. Two days before Christmas, my mother passed away, and you told me that you were there if I needed you. I hope life has been as kind to you as you were to me. God bless you. John Cruitt Doyle says his letter, which arrived in February, could not have come at a better time. Her husband, who passed away this August, was struggling with Parkinson's disease. ""And I had just come home from the hospital, and I read this beautiful letter, and I just was overwhelmed,"" she says. ""Well the funny thing is, when I finally wrote to you again after 54 years, I typed the letter--- I was afraid my penmanship wasn't going to meet your standards,"" Cruitt says as Doyle laughs. ""John, what can I say--- I'm just glad that we made a difference in each other's life."" Doyle believed the letter  _  ."
"My daughter recently asked me what a travel agency does. There is one located on our street and it has just been completely rebuilt. I told her that they helped people book their trips and vacations. ""Why haven't we ever been there?' she wanted to know. ""Because we do everything ourselves online these days."" I explained. ""But why do you do it yourself if other people want to do it for you?"" she wondered out loud. The answer is that the travel agency makes a little bit of money on each ticket you book through them. If you book your ticket yourself online, you save that money. Saving money sounds great except that when you think about it you typically spend three evenings comparing prices to end up saving EUR30 on a EUR300 trip. All those EUR30 discounts add up of course so I guess we should be happy with that. Consider books for a moment. Buying your book at Amazon saves you 30% to 40% on each book. Add to that the convenience of shopping from home and getting the package delivered to your home address. So far so good. Unfortunately, that does mean you spend too much time browsing Amason.com while you could do something fun instead. Like maybe reading an actual book? Then the package arrives and you aren't home and end up having to pick it up at the local post-office. All in all I wonder how much time I end up investing in the whole process. Time sounds free, but to most of us, it is more valuable than money. The Internet Economy promised to get rid of the middle-men and we loved it. Somehow, I'm starting to get the feeling that we ourselves ended up doing the work of the middle-men we were so eager to get rid of. In any project you can always pick two of these: fast, cheap or good. We seem to have focused a lot on ""cheap"" and ""good"" but the extra time we need to invest to also keep it ""fast"" comes out of our own pockets. Your can always make more money, but you can never make more time. What is the best title for the passage?"
"I love music. I learned to play the guitar at 11 and I wrote my first song four years later. My dream -----to become a country singer. After years of hard work, a record company was showing interest in me. One day during a trip to mountains, a friend gave me a bit of meth, a kind of drugs . I smoked it. And that was all that I thought about for the next year and a half. I couldn't live without it. When the police came to me, I looked like death. The first seven days in prison , I just slept. When I woke up on the eighth day, I had never known such shame and guilt . I walked down the hall to the pay phone. My mama is the best person on the earth, and I knew this was going to break her heart. When I heard her voice on the phone, I told her where I was. She just said, ""Son, no matter what you did, I love you forever . Her words gave me the confidence to face my trouble . And I also realized  this was my chance to start a new life. When people hear my words, I hope they will not make the same mistake  as I have, but I know that you can overcome  almost anything, especially smoking drug. That's why I share my story here. Why was the writer put into prison?"
"There was a king who gave his daughter a beautiful diamond necklace. The necklace was stolen and his people in the kingdom searched everywhere but could not find it. So the king asked to search for it and put a reward for$50,000 for anyone who found it. One day, a clerk was walking home along a river when he saw something shinning in the river and when he looked, he saw the diamond necklace. He decided to try and catch it to get the $50,000 reward. He put his hand in the river and tried to catch the necklace, but somehow missed it and didn't catch it. He took his hand out and looked again and the necklace was still there. He tried again. But strangely, he still missed the necklace! He came out and started walking away, feeling sad. Just then, an old man walking by saw him, and asked him what was the matter. The clerk didn't want to share the secret with him, thinking he might take the necklace for himself, so he refused to tell him anything. The old man could see this man was troubled. He again asked the clerk to tell him the problem and promised that he would not tell anyone about it. The clerk told him about the necklace and how he tried and tried to catch it, but kept failing. The old man then told him that perhaps he should try looking upward, toward the branches of the tree, instead of in the river. The clerk looked up and true enough, the necklace was hanging on the branch of a tree. He had been trying to take a reflection of the real necklace all this time. What might be the best title for the passage?"
"Science fiction is a popular kind of writing, and many people think of Jules Verne as the father of science fiction. He was born in France in 1828. His father wanted him to become a lawyer , but when he was about twenty years old, Verne decided to become a writer. At first he wrote plays for the theater. Then, in 1863, he wrote a story called Five Weeks in a Balloon. The success of this book encouraged him to write more stories such as A Journey to the Center of the Earth(1864) and From the Earth to the Moon(1865). In the 19th century, many people were interested in science and inventions. Jules Verne wrote about scientific subjects in his stories and, as a result, they were very popular. Verne's writing included many predictions  for the 20th century and many of them came true. He described space flight, movies, and air conditioning, a long time before they appeared. These books were very successful and they made Verne rich. Jules Verne's books have been the subjects for many movies. 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea was a successful movie for Walt Disney. It was the first Disney movie to use real actors instead of cartoon drawings. Around the World in Eighty Days is another famous movie based on one of Verne's books. The main character is an Englishman called Phileas Fogg. For him, the most important thing is to be always on time! Which of the following has the main character called Phileas Fogg?"
"Why does the rate of heart attacks increase during the World Cup football finals? How can we help an overweight patient to lose weight? They're just some of the topics covered in a new book by University of Sussex academics, which is helping student doctors to consider the importance of psychology in medical practice. Psychology for Medicineis the first textbook of its kind, providing medical trainees and new doctors with all the relevant psychological knowledge they need. Previously, students had to refer to many different books for the relevant psychology. The book, by Sussex psychologists Dr. Sussex Ayers and Dr. Richard de Visser, has been well received by fellow academics and medical doctors and was finished with the help of the students and staff of the Brighton and Sussex Medical School. The studentsproofread  the chapters, provided ideas for the content and even modeled for the photographs. The book provides a solid grounding in psychological study relevant to medicine, along with practical tips and advice for practice. One student, Simon Hall, drew cartoons for the book. The study psychology is important for doctors for a number of reasons. Psychological and physical symptoms are highly related. Up to a third of patients will have psychological disorders, while physical causes are usually only found in around 15 per cent of people's symptoms. In treatment, a lot of the effect drugs can be due to patients believing they will recover rather than the drug itself. Dr. Ayers says, ""The important thing about this book is that it's applied science --- it shows why psychology is important to medicine and how we should use it. The book's presentation is really important. It's not just lots of theory, but full of tips and advice so that students can take what they learn in the classroom and apply it to real-life situations."" We can infer that the text is a(n)   _  ."
"While beach vacations may be a great way to take your mind off work,lakes surrounded by mountains make for an even grander experience.If you are looking for some peace on your vacation,we have some recommendations for you in the Caucasus .

"It had been a long,hard,wonderful day.The two of us had walked from the sea's edge through the length of a beautiful valley,climbed a superb mountain,travelled its narrow,rocky ridge ,and now stood on its final peak,tired,happy and looking for the perfect campsite. The experienced backpacker has a natural feeling for such things,and our eyes were drawn to a small blue circle on the map,like an eye winking at us.We could not see _ from where we were,but we followed our judgement and went down steeply until it came into view. We were right.It was a calm pool,with flat grass beside it.Gently taking our packs off,we made the first of many cups of tea before pulling up our tent.Later that evening,over another cup of tea and after a good meal,we sat outside the tent watching the sunset over a sea dotted with islands,towards one of which a ferry was slowly moving.It is not always so perfect,of course.On another trip,with a different companion,a thoroughly wet day had ended at a lonely farm.Depressed at the thought of camping,we had knocked and asked if we could use a barn  as a shelter. Backpacking could be defined as the art of comfortable,selfsufficient  travel on foot.Everything you need is in the pack on your back,and you become _ .I once left my pack hidden in some rocks while I made a long trip to a peak I particularly wanted to climb.I was away for nearly three hours and ended up running the last stretch in fear that my precious pack would not be there.It was,of course. The speed at which the backpacker travels makes this the perfect way to see any country.You experience the landscape as a slow unfolding scene,almost in the way it was made;and you find time to stop and talk to people you meet.I've learned much local history from simply chatting to people I met while walking through an area.At the end of a trip,whether three days or three weeks,there's a feeling of achievement,of having got somewhere under your own power. After years of going out walking just for the day,many people start backpacking simply through wanting to stay out rather than cut short a trip. How did the writer and his companion feel at the end of the day?"
"For years I fought with the bird's nest that sat on top of my head-my Medusa  hair.No matter what I did and how hard I tried, in no way could I make my unruly  hair to my satisfaction. Growing up in a Russian-Jewish home with parents who thought North American styling products were something illegal such as drugs, I was never allowed to put them in my hair. ""Why buy hair gel? Your hair is so beautiful naturally."" my mother would say.The teens at school did not agree.From boys' not wanting to kiss me when we played spin the bottle in Grade 7 to being called the mop, I suffered from my hair. When I got to university, I believed my hair was a wall that stood between me and everything---finding a part-time job, getting a boyfriend, etc. If only I could find a way to manage the curls and put it behind bars, I told myself, I would feel secure and sexy.I tried everything: rollers, hairspray, gels and, at one point, an iron.Then, in my second year, a miracle happened.I was asked to be a hair model for Japanese hair straightening, a process by which the molecules of my curls would be broken and reset in a bone-straight position.I was the perfect candidate, the hairdresser told me.Although they said how hair relaxing could damage the scalp  , for the next five years I didn't find them to be true. All of the hairdresser's promises were fulfilled: With my hair straight and smooth, I was no longer the "" mop"". However, there was extreme damage done to my wallet. To keep up the straightening cost $ 700 every six months, and that was considered cheap. While some people thought I was crazy, I was willing to do anything to never again feel like that anxious, curly-headed girl in Grade 7.But when I moved out of my parents' house at age 26 and rented an apartment, the upkeep of my new image became too costly. I couldn't hide from my inner Medusa any longer.It was time to hug her and let her fly.Seeking a choice, I turned to the Internet, Google.After hours of searching, I hit upon a ""curly haired"" salon, a place designed for girls like me. I doubted these so-called ""Curl Ambassadors"" could do anything without using machine of some sort, and though I bought the service called the ""Curly-Doo"", I suspected I'd have the same unruly mop at the end of the appointment. I dragged my feet so hard getting there that I arrived 45 minutes late.I secretly hoped they would turn me away.Instead, my stylist simply said: ""You are very late.Let me see your hair"". At that moment, my world and beliefs about myself were turned upside down along with my hair. As my head was in a basin full of freezing-cold water, then covered with a jelly-like jam, I wondered what I had got myself into. ""Do you really think this will work?"" I asked the stylist, Jones."" My curls are a disaster."" ""No curly hair is hopeless,"" she replied.""They just haven't found a way to work with it, that's all."" After the hour was over, Jones had completed her work.She had styled my hair using only her hands, water and a mixture of organic jam.I couldn't believe what I was seeing in the mirror: a naturally curly, Medusa-free me.You could argue that hair is just hair. Yet, it is just such physical features that have such a large influence on how we view ourselves. According to Jones,75 percent of the population have a wave or curl in their hair and don't know what to do with it.Men cut theirs short.Women flat-iron theirs to death.When I read through a beauty magazine or take the subway to work, it makes me sad to see so many people repressing their natural beauty. Since then, my world has changed.I have always been outgoing, but these days I seem to be more outspoken and confident than ever.On top of that, friends and co-workers tell me I am looking better than ever, but they don't know the source of the change. I don't need to tell them. My Medusa hair speaks for herself. The writer's world has changed because she_."

"IMAGINE if, to collect your salary each month, you had to walk to the nearest town, perhaps tens of miles away, to gather in a school or a football court or a church. There, you and your colleagues wait for a man to arrive from the capital, perhaps a thousand miles away, with a suitcase of cash. Few countries are as corrupt as Congo . Mobutu Sese Seko, a former strongman, used state funds to _ a Concorde to take him on shopping trips to Paris. By the time of his overthrow in 1997, graft was endemic. Government employees were not paid but rather expected to use their positions to make a living. Among the most prized government jobs was that of accountant: the people responsible for transporting bags of cash to the provinces to hand out to employees. In 2012, however, the Congolese government started helping civil servants to open bank accounts. Around three-quarters of them--some 670,000 people--now have one. In the process, the government has weeded out tens of thousands of ghost employees, since the embezzlers who invented them could not open accounts in their names without a matching ID. Yet in a vast country with fewer roads than Luxembourg, hardly anyone lives anywhere near a bank branch. So Congolese banks must now do the work the government accountants used to: shipping money to the remote area. Cash has to be transported to branches in regional capitals, and thence to account-holders on the backs of motorbikes, in canoes or by foot. Bank staff with suitcases of cash make easy targets, just as they did in the west of America in the 19th century. Though they usually travel with armed policemen, there have been at least ten armed robberies of bank employees since January. At the moment banks are little more than money-transfer companies, and not very sophisticated ones at that. The transfers tend to go only one way--out of Kinshasa--so cannot be netted against each other; instead cash almost always has to be moved physically. Therefore, most Congolese bankers hope that the new system will promote the growth of a proper banking system. What is not one of the challenges that bank staff have to face while transferring each?"

Standing there, I could see she was going to cry. I tried not to disturb her but she welcomed me by asking ""Have you ever said goodbye to someone knowing it would be forever?"" ""Yes,"" I replied. ""But may I know why this is the final goodbye?"" ""I am ill and she lives so far away. It's highly possible that the next trip back will be for my funeral "" she said. ""When you were saying goodbye, I heard you say 'I wish you enough'. May I ask what that means?"" ""That's a wish that has been handed down from past generations. My parents used to say it to everyone."" She paused for a moment and looked up as if trying to remember it in detail and she smiled even more. ""When we say 'I wish you enough', we want the other person to have a life filled with just enough good things to be with them"". Then turning to me, she shared the following: ""I wish you enough sun to keep your attitude bright. ""I wish you enough rain to appreciate the sun more."" Which of the following about ""I wish you enough"" is TRUE?"
"A British farmer has been searching for a group of fighter planes for 15 years. The planes were lost in Burma during World War II. David Cundall, 62, traveled to Burma a dozen times. He spent about US $207,000 in the hope of finding a British Spitfire buried in the Southeast Asian country. Finally, his hard work paid off. Cundall started his search after his friend heard from a group of U.S. war veterans that they had buried Spitfires in the region. ""We've done some pretty silly things in our time, but the silliest was burying Spitfires,"" the veterans said. Cundall began placing ads in magazines to try to find soldiers who might have been involved. After 15 years of searching, he finally managed to locate the missing airplanes. The planes had never been flown and were buried in their transport crates . ""We made a borehole and used a camera to look at the crates. They seemed to be in good condition."" Cundall told The Telegraph. The aircraft had arrived at a Royal Air Force base in Burma in August 1945. But, by that point in the war, the planes weren't needed. ""In 1945, Spitfires were _ , and you could see them everywhere."" Said Cundall. British Prime Minister, David Camerion, recently visited the country. As The Telegraph reports, Camerion's help may mean that the Spitfires could soon be on their way back to the United Kingdom. Cundall hopes that with the help of investors, the planes can finally take to the skies. ""Spitfires are beautiful aeroplanes and should not be rotting away in a foreign land,"" Cundall says. ""They saved our neck in the Battle of Britain and they should be protected."" Which of the following is the best title for the text?"
"There once was a small boy who liked to wiggle.  He would wiggle everywhere he went. He would wiggle during supper when he was eating his food.  He would wiggle down the winding path outside his house. He could wiggle his right knee when he walked, and that gave his wiggle even more wiggle.  One day, his grandpa was watching the boy wiggle.  His grandpa was old and liked to cough.  He had a long beard that was grey at the top. He was tired of watching the boy wiggle, and thought the boy was wiggling around a little too much. So, his grandpa gave the boy a pea and told him it was a magic pea. He said the magic pea would stop his wiggle. The boy started roaring with laughter. He didn't believe a pea could stop his wiggle.  The grandpa put the pea in a little square bag and tied it around the boy's waist.  The boy tried to wiggle, but he couldn't wiggle at all. All he could do was walk straight. That was no fun. What good was a boy if he couldn't wiggle when he wanted?  The grandpa coughed and smiled. He enjoyed watching the boy not wiggle any more. What happened when the boy got the pea?"
"People eat different things in different parts of the world. In some countries, people eat rice every day. Sometimes they eat it two or three times a day for breakfast, lunch and supper. They eat rice with meat, fish and vegetables. Some people do not eat some kinds of meat. Muslims  ,for example, do  not eat pork. Japanese eat lots of fish. They are near the  sea. So it is easy for them to get fish. In some western countries such as Britain, Australia and the USA, the most important food is bread and potatoes. People there can cook potatoes in many different ways. Some people eat only fruit and vegetables. They do not eat meat or fish or anything from animals. They only eat food from plants  .

"If you know exactly what you want, the best way to get a job is to get specialized training. A recent survey shows that companies like graduates in such fields as business and health care who can go to work immediately with very little on-the-job training. That's especially true of booming fields that are challenging for workers. At Cornell's School of Hotel Administration, for example, bachelor's degree graduates get an average of four or five job offers with salaries ranging from the high teens to the low 20s and plenty of chances for rapid advancement. Large companies, especially, like a background of formal education coupled with work experience. But in the long run, too much specialization doesn't pay off. Business, which has been flooded with MBAs, no longer considers the degree an automatic stamp of approval. The MBA may open doors and command a higher salary initially, but . As further evidence of companies gradually losing faith in specialized degrees, Michigan State's Scheetz mentions a pattern in hiring practices. Although companies tend to take on specialists as new hires, they often seek out generalists for middle and upper-level management.  ""They want someone who isn't constrained by details to look at the big picture,"" says  Scheetz. This sounds like a formal statement that you approve of the liberal-arts  graduates. Time and again labor-market analysts mention a need for talents that liberal-arts majors are assumed to have: writing and communication skills, organizational skills, open-mindedness and adaptability, and the ability to analyze and solve problems. David Birch, manager of the Boston Red Sox, claims he does not hire anybody with an MBA or an engineering degree, ""I hire only liberal-arts people because they have a less-than-canned way of doing things,"" says Birch. For a liberal-arts degree, students focus on some basic courses that include literature, history, mathematics, economics, science, human behavior--plus a computer course or two. With these useful and important courses, you can feel free to specialize, ""A liberal-arts degree coupled with an MBA or some other technical training is a very good combination in the marketplace,"" says Scheetz.

"During the 15 days from New Year's Eve to Lantern Festival , Beijing was affected  by haze  .Do you know what the haze is ? Today I will introduce it to you . Haze is air pollution  in which is mixed up with dust, smoke and other dry particles (,),and it covers  our blue sky ,so we can't see sunny days. It often happens in winter and spring. The haze brings much trouble  to people's lives. On the road many traffic accidents  happened because people can not see clearly. The haze is _ to our health. People also have to go to see the doctor because of the poisonous  air caused by the haze. As students, we must tell our friends and family members to go to work or school with the public traffic, such as the bus and the underground and BRT .Also we should plant more trees and develop green and energy to reduce  the haze. According to me, I will go to school by bike or on foot, and I won't throw the waste  anywhere . It may take about 20 years to solve the problems caused by the haze .I believe the environment will get better and better and haze weather will vanish completely with the help of new technology.

"What is the hottest topic at your school recently? In Taiyuan No.55 Middle School, it's money. The school held an activity called ""making money"" last weekend. About 200 Junior 1 and Junior 2 students were divided into 30 teams. They went out to make money by selling things. What did they choose to sell? Some sold newspapers; some chose bottled water; some sold environmentally friendly shopping bags and bamboo baskets. Hu Qing's team decided to sell some useful books in front of the Children Activity Center. They thought parents would like to buy the books for their children. But unfortunately, they met urban management officers  . The officers asked them to leave. ""We played hide-and-seek   with the officers for the whole morning"" said Hu. ""Finally we had to give up."" Wang Bing and her team sold ice cream in a square. They didn't meet any officers. But few people were interested in what they were selling. The team then put up a board saying ""For Country Kids"". It worked. More people came to their stall  . A foreigner even gave them 100 yuan. ""He didn't want any change. He said he wanted to help the children,"" said Wang. ""We were touched."" Later that day they gave the 100 yuan and more to the ""Project Hope"" office. Meng Zhaoxiang and his team were luckier. They sold all their cakes in four hours, spending 39.5 yuan and getting back 80 yuan. They made 40.5 yuan. ""It was not easy to make the money,"" said Meng. ""Some people just looked. Others just tasted but didn't buy. Now I know how hard it is for our parents to make the money we need to lead happy lives."" .

"You may have noticed that the world's population is not evenly distributed  around our planet. There are some countries where people seem to be living nearly _ each other because conditions are overcrowded. Then there are others where it seems that hardly anybody lives. What influences this unequal distribution of people? There are specific advantages and disadvantages of *diving in a certain area. The two main factors that influence people`s choice of location are climate and resources. Climate is the usual weather conditions in a region. Areas that have bad weather are generally less deal as places to live in. The north and south poles at the top and bottom of the world may be beautiful in their rugged, natural way, but the disadvantage of the bitterly cold and windy conditions usually keeps people away.  When it comes to climate, warm conditions and a normal amount of rainfall are advantages that attract people. Natural resources are things that we get from nature that help us survive. Each region offers different resources, and therefore attracts different groups of people. People who enjoy the beach can make their living by catching and selling the ocean's many fish and other sea creatures. Those who prefer farming can take advantage of rich soil  in valleys near rivers. Some people are willing to accept the disadvantages of the terrible conditions of deserts or mountains in order to take advantage of the resources like oil or woods. What are the main factors that influence the distribution of people?"
"Standing in line for the latest iPhone at the Apple store, queuing for tickets to Wimbledon or even just waiting at the post office might just have got a lot easier. Japanese car-maker Nissan announces that it has just the thing to relieve the painful legs of tired queuers. The new system of 'self-driving' chairs is designed to detect when someone at the front of the queue is called, and automatically move everyone else one step forward in line. The new invention is shown off in a company video, which shows a busy restaurant with patrons waiting outside. In the video, diners are sitting in a row of chairs, but will not have to stand when the next hungry diner is called to a table. Instead, the chairs, equipped with autonomous technology that detects the seat ahead, move along a path toward the front of the line. When the person at the front of the queue is called, the empty chair at the front can sense it is empty and so moves out of pole position. Cameras on the remaining chairs then sense the movement and follow automatically. The system, which is similar to the kind used in Nissan's autonomous vehicle technology, will be tested at select restaurants in Japan this year, Nissan said. ""It appeals to anyone who has queued for hours outside a crowded restaurant: it _ the boredom and physical pain of standing in line,"" Nissan added. Although Tokyo has some 160,000 restaurants, long queues are not uncommon. Chosen restaurants that meet the criteria will be able to show the chairs outside their restaurant next year. Nissan also released a short video showing the chairs being used in an art gallery, moving slowly in front of the various paintings to let viewers appreciate the art without the need to stand up. What can we know about ""self-driving"" chairs from the text?"
"They can be seen more frequently than ever before on college campuses, wearing flannel  and thickframed glasses while listening to music. One might find them playing unusual musical instruments, shopping at secondhand stores or expressing themselves in other unique ways. They call themselves hipsters. Being ""hip"" used to mean following the latest fashion. But gradually the word has become a sign of ""being cool, unique and unusual"". Hipsters value independent thinking, progressive politics, an appreciation of creativity and intelligence. Hipsters take pains and pride in not being mainstream. However, their culture has become quite trendy. This irony  is central to their culture and offers an interesting conflict. ""I do take things in the mainstream with a positive attitude,"" says Ben Polson, a college student at Brown University. ""But sometimes I also question what determines popularity, especially regarding music."" Polson represents many hipsters. When lessknown bands become popular, they often lose their former fan base in exchange for a new one. There is a famous hipster saying that goes, ""I used to like that band before it got popular,"" Polson quoted. According to Polson, bands' music changes when they go mainstream. They become less experimental, doing things just to save popularity and fans. The original elements that we were drawn to slowly disappear for the sake of popularity. Many young adults have started to view hipsters' outlook as cool and they are adopting hipsters' antimainstream culture mind to themselves. This has led to specialized brands, stores and music for the hipster consumers. But on the other hand, some such stores, including clothing labels Urban Outfitters and American Apparel, have gained mainstream popularity. This has seemingly made the antimainstream culture become weaker. ""A lot of people that are selfdefined hipsters aren't really hipsters. They're just trying to act as hipsters to seem cooler,"" says Amanda Leopold, a college student from Oberlin College, US. Although Leopold has many unusual tastes and seems quite individualist, she refuses to classify herself as a hipster. According to the author,   _  ."
"There was once a boy who hardly had any toys or money. Nevertheless, he was a very happy little boy. He said that what made him happy was doing things for others, and that doing so gave him a nice feeling inside. However, no one really believed him, they thought he was silly. He spent all day helping others, dispensing  charity to the poorest, and looking after abandoned animals. Very seldom did he ever do anything for himself. One day, he met a famous doctor who thought the boy's case was so peculiar that he decided to investigate him. So, with a complex system of cameras and tubes, the doctor managed to record what was happening inside the boy. What he discovered was surprising. Each time the boy did something good, a thousand tiny angels gathered around the boy's heart and started tickling it. That explained the boy's happiness, but the doctor continued studying until he discovered that we all have our own thousand angels inside us. Unfortunately, he found that, as we do so few good things, the angels spend most of their time wandering about, bored. And so it was that the secret to happiness was discovered. Thanks to that little boy we now know exactly what we have to do to feel our hearts being tickled. What does the passage try to teach us?"

"A disastrous competition is going on in England, with billions of dollars and hundreds of lives in danger. OK, that's not true. But competitors from around the world gathered on Thursday to compete for the title of 2012's World's Biggest Liar. Each participant is given up to five minutes to make up the best lie in the competition, which was started in honor of 19th-century Bridge Inn owner Will Ritson, who was reportedly famous for his lies. Competitors gather at the Bridge Inn every year for the competition, a small pub in northwestern England. Anyone can take part in the competition. Well, almost anyway; the reporters note that lawyers and politicians are banned, who is said to enjoy ""an unfair advantage"" in the proceedings . A study published this past July in the journal Evolution & Human Behavior found that nearly all lies are detectable through visible facial muscle   reactions in the person telling a lie. ""Thus, while interpersonal deception   often is highly successful, signs of hidden emotional states are communicated clearly to the informed observer,"" the study concluded. A churchman of Carlisle reportedly holds what may be the greatest lie of all time in the competition, simply stating, ""I have never told a lie in my life."" In 2003, Abrie Krueger of South Africa became the first non-Brit to win the competition. Ironically, Krueger was accused by some of cheating. In 2006, comedian Sue Perkins became the first female to win the competition, telling a tale about people riding camels to work as a result of climate change. Last year's winning entry came from Glen Boyland, who told a lie about competing in a snail-racing   competition with Prince Charles.

"In our home it was natural to fear our father . Even our mother was afraid of him. As children, my sister and I thought every family was like that. Every family had an unpredictable dad who was impossible to please and a praying mom who was there to protect the children. We were good children. Mom was always telling us we were, even if Daddy couldn't see it . part of this was because we didn't dare to do anything. Then came the day we found something new and fun to do. We worked at drawing with chalk on our wooden front door and making lots of pretty pictures all over it. We had a great time. We thought Mom would love it and praise us. The praise we expected did not come. Instead, Mom was mad. We did not understand why, but we knew we were in big trouble!  Off we ran to find a place to hid. In our wooded yard it was not hard for two small children to find safety. Together, we hid behind a tree and did not move. Soon we heard the frightened voices of Mom and our neighbors calling out to us. The sun set and it began to get dark. Those around us became more anxious, and we became more frightened. However, we still didn't move. As we clung together in the dark, we became aware of yet another voice, one we recognized with great fear: our daddy. But there was something strangely different about it. In it we heard something we had never heard before: fear, agony and despair. Then came his prayers in tearful voice. Our daddy was promising God that he would give his life to him if he would safely return his girls. Nothing in our lives had prepared us for this kind of shock. Neither of us remembers making a decision to come out. We were drawn to him like a magnet , our fears disappearing into the forest. We didn't know yet if we actually took steps or if God somehow moved us out and into Daddy's arms. What we do remember were those strong, loving arms holding us and crying, hugging us like we were precious. Things were different after that.  _ . Our whole family was changed by a piece of chalk.

"Tiny monitoring devices have become an increasingly common way for scientists to study elusive animals that are difficult to track on a day-to-day basis. However, now it seems that smart. seals have caught on to the trick and are using it to their advantage to catch fish! To find out if that is true, a team of researchers from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland selected a group often young grey seals that had neither encountered the ocean nor been exposed to any kind of acoustic tags. The researchers then placed the seals one at a time, inside a pool that contained 20 foraging boxes, only two of which housed fish -- one with tags and the other without. Each seal was allowed to explore the boxes twenty separate times. In order to ensure that mammal was not depending on its memory, the fish were moved to different boxes each time. At first, there was no difference in the amount of time it took the seals to discover the tagged and untagged fish. However, after they had been in the pool a few times, they started locating the tagged fish much faster. To confirm that this indeed was the case, there searchers conducted a second experiment using two boxes -- one with pieces of fish and the other with just acoustic tags. Sure enough, the seals were all attracted to the one that was sending out signals. While this experiment involved only seals, the researchers believe that other marine mammals may also be using the information to catch prey. Sadly, predators like sharks that have been tagged by scientists may be negatively affected, as pings they emit could warn their prey of their presence. Besides potentially messing up nature's food chain, the ""dinner bell"" effect of the acoustic tags could also mean that the conclusions reached by previous fish studies may not be correct. Now that the secret is out, scientists will have to come up with another way to conduct their studies -- one that is not detectable by the crafty marine animals. After doing the two experiments the researchers most probably concluded that   _  ."
"When did you last see a polar bear ? On a trip to a zoo, perhaps? If you had attended a winter activity in New York a few years ago, you would have seen a whole polar bear club. These ""Polar Bears"" are people who meet frequently in the winter to swim in freezing cold water. That day, the air temperature was 3degC, and the water temperature was a bit higher. The members of the Polar Bears Club at Coney Island, New York are usually about the age of 60. Members must satisfy two requirements. First, they must get along well with everyone else in the group; this is very important because there are so many different kinds of people in the club. Polar Bears must also agree to swim outdoors at least twice a month from November through February. Doctors do not agree about the medical effects of cold-water swimming. Some are worried about the dangers of a condition in which the body's temperature drops so low that finally the heart stops. Other doctors, however, point out that there is more danger of a heart attack during summer swimming because the difference between the air temperature and water temperature is much greater in summer than in winter. The Polar Bears themselves are satisfied with the benefits(or advantages)of cold-water swimming. They say that their favorite form of exercise is very good for the circulatory system  because it forces the blood to move fast to keep the body warm. Cold-water swimmers usually turn bright red after a few minutes in the water. A person who turns blue probably has a very poor circulatory system and should not try cold-water swimming. The main benefits(or advantages)of cold-water swimming are probably mental. The Polar Bears love to swim year-round; they find it fun and relaxing.

"Be sure to book a table if the restaurant you choose is an expensive or a popular one. You will feel embarrassed to show up without booking and having to wait for a table, leaving very bad impression on your friend, especially your girl friend. Also, be sure to check to see if you need to be properly dressed and tell your friend ahead of time what to wear.    When your food arrives, proper dining manners make you eat at a right pace so that you have time to talk. A good measure of how fast you should eat is to count 10 seconds between each mouthful and it's bad manners if you eat too fast and then spend the rest of the time watching your friend eat.    Don't make noise when having soup and chewing, or chew with your mouth open.    Your napkin should be placed on your lap at all times. Don't put it in any other place. If you have to get up, place it neatly on your seat.    When eating, put your fork straight in your mouth. Don't place your fork in the side of your mouth as it increases the chances of dropping your food, which could be very embarrassing.

"Most Americans get what money they have from their work; that is, they earn an income from wages or salaries. The richest Americans, however, get most of their money from what they own -- their stocks, bonds, real estate, and other forms of property, or wealth. Although there are few accurate statistics to go by, wealth in American society appears to be concentrated in very few hands. More than 20 percent of everything that can be privately owned is held by less than one percent of the adult population and more than 75 percent of all wealth is owned by 20 percent of American adults. The plain fact is that most Americans have no wealth at all aside from their homes, automobiles, and a small amount of savings. Income in the United States is not as highly concentrated as wealth. In 1917 the richest 10 percent of American families received 26.1 percent of all income, while the poorest 10 percent received 17 percent, mainly from Social Security and other government payments. The most striking aspect of income distribution is that it has not changed significantly since the end of World War II. Although economic growth has roughly doubled real disposable   family income (the money left after taxes and adjusted for inflation) over the last generation, the size of the shares given to the rich and the poor is about the same. By any measure economic inequality is great in the United States. The reality behind these statistics is that a large number of Americans are poor. In 1918, 14 percent of the population was living below the federal government's poverty line, which at that time was an annual income of $ 9 287 for a nonfarm family of two adults and two children. In other words, about one out of seven Americans over 31 million people was officially considered unable to buy the basic necessities of food, clothes, and shelter. The suggested poverty line in 1981 would have been an income of about $11, 200 for a family of four. By this relative definition, about 20 percent of the population or more than 45 million Americans are poor. What is the percentage of wealth that is in the hands of most Americans?"
"It's 10:30 pm, and 11-year-old Brandon Blanco is sound asleep at home. Suddenly, a loud noise wakes him up. Naturally, Brandon reaches for his cell phone. The message becomes clear: ""R U awake?"" Brandon' s use of technology doesn' t stop there. He also has a computer, a TV and three video-game consoles ( ) in his room. With so many choices, it' s no surprise that when he isn' t at school, he spends nearly every waking minute using one or more of these devices Brandon is hardly alone. According to a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, kids aged 8 to18 are spending more time than ever before using electronic devices. How much time? More than seven and a half hours a day on average, the study found. The jump is the result of a huge explosion in mobile devices, says Victoria Rideout, the lead author of the study. Today, nearly seven out of ten kids have cell phones. Just five years ago, it was four out of ten. Often, kids multitask, or use more than one device at a time. "" If you've got a chance to do something on your computer and take a phone call and have the TV on in the background, why not?"" media expert Cheryl Olson says. Most experts agree technology has much to offer kids. But some worry the kids could be missing out on other activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends.

"Mark Twain was my hero when I was nine because that was when I discovered Tom Sawyer. But even at the height of my admiration, I couldn't agree with him that Anne, the main character inAnne of Green Gables, was ""the dearest and most loveable child in fiction since the best-known Alice"". I had readAnne of Green Gables as well asTom Sawyer, and she had made me as sick as a dog. Another Mark Twain's quote will explain my problem. He said, ""When I was a boy of 14, my father was so ignorant   that I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be 21, I was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years."" I gradually understood his words as growing up. When I picked up the book again a few years later, I too was astonished at how much it had improved--and shortly afterwards shocked by the fact that not only could I be a fool in all sporting, artistic and practical matters, I could also be so when it came to reading too. On rereading, then, I learned that Anne is indeed a dear and most lovable child. I couldn't help adoring the girl who insists that her name be spelled with the ""e"" instead of Ann as she believes that is ""so much more distinguished."" She is a brave and determined survivor of a severe upbringing who has refused to let her circumstances crush her spirit. She arrives at Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert's farm with everything unfavorable--orphaned, unwanted and her biggest trouble of red-hair and freckled   face. However, she gets along well, through her strange way of seeing things, through her honest love of beauty and lovable attempts to master her unreasonable desires. She finally wins over the Cuthberts, their neighbors and millions of readers who have met her over the 101 years since the book was first published.  When I settle down with it these days, I've come to see the truth in Mark Twain's praise for the book, and this reminds me of the great truth that you are never too young to start rereading.

"Two weeks ago while my daughter and I were eating dinner I saw a police officer walking past my backyard with a worried looking woman following. I went out, opened my door and asked if everything was okay. The woman was the grandmother of an eight-year-old boy who had gone missing an hour before. She was so anxious that she looked pale. With fear she trembled all the time. They came to ask us about it. I said we hadn't seen the boy, but we would help to look for him. I asked my two-year-old daughter if she understood why we had to go looking for this boy and couldn't finish dinner right then. She replied, ""Be kind people, Daddy.""  _ ! We hopped  into our truck and went searching all over the town for about an hour and a half. Along the way, as we asked various strangers on the street if they had seen this little boy. A group of kids said they would help too. They hopped on their bikes and joined the search without any hesitation. I was surprised and very impressed. What a moving scene! The little boy was found safe and sound a few miles away in forest. He had just decided to go on a little adventure on his own as his story said. Finding him, his grandmother was moved to tear. I was just so happy to see so many people joined the search for a complete stranger. At least two dozen people from the neighborhood went looking for this boy just because being""kind people""was the right thing to do. Where do you think the writer was having dinner?"
"The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league with 32 teams in. How does one choose which team to support? Some people choose the team of their hometown, or where they now live, or the team that their parents or their friends follow.[:ZXXK] A boy student from Oklahoma wrote a letter to each of the owners or presidents of the 32 NFL teams. He would see what answers he got, and then choose his team. Bill was home from school sick. It was the week before Christmas. He was ""kind of bored"" and needed something to do. So he asked his parents if he could write to every professional football team. Bill wrote the 32 letters by hand. ""We weren't quite sure what we could get back. He didn't really have one team that he wanted to hear from,"" his mother said: ""He just wanted to see what kind of reply he' d get."" A letter to the Carolina Panthers' owner Jerry Richardson was one of those posted. Bill wrote in his letter, ""My family and I love football. They are fans of different teams.But I don't have a team to cheer for yet. I am ready to pick an NFL team to cheer on for lifetime!"" A few weeks later, Bill's mother was pulling into her driveway when a delivery man arrived with a box from the Panthers. When Bill came home, he excitedly opened the box. Inside he found a signed Carolina Panthers helmet as well as a handwritten note from Jerry. The team owner had written to Bill, ""We should be honored if our Carolina Panthers became your team. We would make you proud of your joining us."" Bill was overjoyed with what he got. He decided that from then on he would support the Panthers. He keeps the letter from Jerry in his bedroom. His mother says, ""It's not the helmet they sent us. It's what they told us."" That is what mattered to Bill and why he chose to become a Panthers' fan. It's clear that  _  ."
"In South America, the rich soil of the Amazon River basin in Brazil is known as ""black gold"". Scientists found that the secret of this rich soil was charcoal . Local people made it from animal bones and tree branches. They mixed the charcoal with the soil about 1.500 years ago. Now, scientists in the United States have done a modern demonstration. They say charcoal fertilization offers a revolutionary way to improve soil quality for hundreds or even thousands of years. Mingxin Guo and his team at Delavare State University heated tree leaves, corn stalks , small pieces of wood and poultry waste into ""biochar"" . They reported their findings at a recent meeting of the American Chemical Society in New Orleans. Biochar could be good news for farmers with poor soil and hungry populations to feed. Professor Guo says it could even help against global warming. Intensive  farming and overuse of chemical fertilizer give out carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Biochar does the opposite, he says. It traps carbon in the ground. The researchers planted winter wheat in containers of soil in a greenhouse -- some with biochar, some without. Professor Guo says the wheat grows much better in the pots with biochar. The soil was added two percent charcoal to. But he says even a one percent treatment will increase productivity. The results demonstrated that biochar can increase organic matter in soil. Loss of nutrients in soil is an increasing problem worldwide as farmers try to grow more food for growing populations. Next, the team will carry out a five-year study of biochar with spinach , green peppers and tomatoes. Mingxin Guo says he learns about the ""black gold"" in Brazil from a magazine story. He explains that it was discovered in the jungle, in the area where waters flow to the Amazon, in the 1960's. But it was not until recent years that scientists began to bring public attention to it.

"Can you swim? Swimming is one of the most popular activities in summer. It can be learned early in life. Little children can learn to swim as soon as they walk. In fact, you need the same skills in walking as in swimming. However, I believe that five is the best age to learn it. By five or six, a child knows fear of water, a very important thing to know. It's wise to be afraid. The young understand that the water can sometimes be very dangerous. When you swim, you should follow certain rules: Never swim alone! No matter how good you are in the water, don't risk drowning by swimming alone. If you swim by yourself, you may get into trouble. Don't go beyond your abilities. Most swimmers know it clearly not to swim too far from the bank or the beach. Don't show off your skills by doing dangerous tricks. Don't smoke. Swimming depends on a healthy body. Work at any activity that builds muscles  . According to the passage, you should not swim alone because  _  ."

"Ever get that feeling you're being watched? Well, if you're a dog-owner, you may have a point. Dogs are able to watch people's interactions with one another to determine who holds yummier treats, according to a new study. This study joins others that show dogs are good observers of human behaviors and feelings. It offers evidence that dogs use information not only from people's direct interactions with them, but also their interactions with one another. In the study, dogs watched a man ask two women for some of their corns. Both women gave the man corns when he asked, but in response to one woman, the man showed his enthusiasm and said the corns were so delicious. In response to the other woman, he gave the corns back and called them _ (in Spanish;the study was conducted in Argentina). After these interactions, the man left and an assistant holding the dog let the dog go. While many dogs didn't approach either woman, the dogs that did have a preference tended to prefer the woman with the yummier  food. Other studies of dogs' people-watching ability have found dogs are able to tell the difference between happy and sad faces in their owners. They prefer people who give others food when asked over people who don't give others food. And in one study, dogs turned toward crying people more often than toward talking people. So how much do dogs really understand about the humans around them? That's not totally settled yet. In a strange twist to the Argentine study above, when the researchers tried an experiment in which they put two plates of corns on a table and had a man react to each plate, dogs didn't preferentially approach the tastier plate afterward. You could say dogs watch for the interaction between two persons, not just how a person reacts. Yet a previous study found dogs will choose boxes that people reacted to happily, but not boxes people reacted to with a disgusted face. Well, either way, you can be sure Fluffs is keeping an eye on you, to the best of her ability. The study was published in the journal PLOS One. Which is one of the procedures of the Argentine study?"
"My father was, by nature, a cheerful, kindly man.Until he was thirty-four years old he worked as a farm-hand for Thomas Butterworth near the town of Bidwell, Ohio.On Saturday evenings he drove his horse into town to spend a few hours in social intercourse with other farm-hands.He was quite happy in his position in life. It was in his thirty-fifth year that father married my mother, a school teacher.Something happened to the two people.The American passion for getting up in the world took possession of them.Mother induced father to give up his place as a farm-hand, sell his horse and start an independent enterprise of his own.They rented ten acres of poor stony land and launched into chicken raising. One inexperienced in such matters can have no idea of the many and tragic things that can happen to a chicken.It is born out of an egg, lives for a few weeks as a tiny fluffy thing, then becomes naked, gets diseases, and dies.A few hens, and now and then a rooster, intended to serve God's mysterious ends, struggle through to maturity.The hens lay eggs out of which come other chickens and the awful cycle is thus made complete.It is all unbelievably complex. _ .One hopes for so much from a chicken and is so awfully disappointed.Small chickens, look so bright and in fact so awfully stupid.They are so much like people they mix one up in one's judgments of life.If disease does not kill them they wait until your expectations are thoroughly aroused and then walk under the wheels of a carriage. In later life I have seen how a literature has been built up on the subject of fortunes to be made out of the raising of chickens.It is intended to be read by the gods who have just eaten of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.It is a hopeful literature and declares that much may be done by simple ambitious people who own a few hens.Do not be misguided by it.It was not written for you.Go hunt for gold on the frozen hills of Alaska, put your faith in the honesty of a politician, believe if you will that good will defeat evil, but do not read and believe the literature that is written concerning the hen. For ten years my father and mother struggled to make our chicken farm pay and then they gave up that struggle and began another.They moved into the town of Bidwell, Ohio and began the restaurant business, with the tiny hope of looking for a new place from which to start on our upward journey through life.

Stacey's brain injury was the most severe. Despite all attempts to save her, she died two days later. When I became conscious, I heard my husband talking to the organ donor coordinator . We knew that Stacey would want that because that's the kind of person she was. She always wanted to assist people. She was always smiling and brought so much joy to others. She was friendly and enjoyed writing stories and poetry. It has been a comfort to know that Stacey lives on in the lives of others. I have even met the family of one of Stacey's kidney recipients  . This little girl was 6 years old at the time of the transplant. She was suffering from Nephrotic Syndrome. I saw pictures showing the effects of the Nephrotic Syndrome and the pictures of her after the transplant. _ already showed an amazing difference. We correspond every year through letters, cards and pictures. The girl is doing really well at school and will be graduating from high school next year. I am so grateful that we have this relationship. I also feel relieved that my daughter has made so great a difference to a person's life. Over the years, I have had some kind of contact with all of the recipients except the heart recipient. I'm very sorry for that. I would love to hear something from the heart recipient's family. There are so many things that I wonder about her. I wonder if she is anything like Stacey. Does she smile all the time? Does she enjoy writing stories and poetry? I do hope that they can contact us!

"Matt and his wife lived in the country. Matt was very mean and hated spending money. One day a fair came to the nearby town. They went to the fair and looked at all the things to buy. Matt's wife wanted to buy a hat only costing $28, but was refused. Later on, a comb of $5 attracted her attention, but he would not let her spend any money. Then, in a nearby field, they saw a small airplane. ""Fun flight!"" the notice said, ""$10 for 10 minutes."" Matt had never been in an airplane and he wanted to go on a fun flight. However, he didn't want to pay for his wife either. ""I've only got $10,"" he told the pilot. ""Can my wife come with me for free?"" The pilot wasn't selling many tickets, so he said, ""I'll make a bargain with you. If your wife doesn't scream, she can have a free flight."" Matt agreed, and got into the small airplane with his wife. The pilot took off and made his airplane do all kinds of things. At one moment it was flying upside down. When the plane landed, the pilot said, ""OK, your wife didn't make a sound. She can have her ride free."" ""Thank you,"" Matt said, ""it wasn't easy for her, you know, especially when she fell out."" How much did the couple spend at the fair?"
"Maddie Messe, 13, has always loved Temple Run, a mobile game that sends her racing through swamps   and forests to outrun a pack of crazed monkeys. What she didn't love was being forced to play as a boy -- unless she was willing to buy a female version. ""I felt like l was being cheated or misrepresented,"" Maddie explains.""Girls are just as capable   of running away from monkeys as boys are."" So last winter, Maddie researched 50 of the most popular iPhone games. What she found was infuriating:90 percent offered free male characters, but only 15 percent let you play as a female for free. Armed with those statistics, Maddie drafted a spirited article and fired it off to several major newspapers. The Washington Post agreed to run the piece, which attracted millions of readers around the globe -- including the makers of Temple Run! ""We realized she had a point,"" says Natalia Luckyanova, the game's co-creator. ""It was the kick in the pants we needed to say,'We should fix it.'So we did."" Now you can play Temple Run with a female character for free, but Maddie hopes her campaign inspires something deeper.""If you don't see characters that look like you on TV or in movies or games, speak up! Just do your research first,""says Maddie. ""One well-supported argument is much more effective than a million angry complaints."" What did Maddie hate about Temple Run?"

"In many countries, unusual names for children are becoming more popular, especially when more and more stars give their children special names. In Britain, you can call a child almost anything you like except dirty words. Some parents choose names which come from popular culture. Because of the film the Lord of the Rings , six boys were named Gandalf. Names about sport are very common, too. Since 1984, 36 children have been called Arsenal after the football team. Other parents like to make up names, or combine  two names to make a special one. A mother in Britain invented the name Tiaamii for her daughter. She combined the names Thea and Amy (the two grandmothers). In China, there are some rules about names --- you can't use foreign letters or symbols  in a Chinese name. For example, parents are not allowed to name their baby @. In New Zealand, a name beginning with a number is not allowed. Other countries have stricter rules about calling children. For example, Japan, Denmark, Spain, Germany and Argentina have a list of names. Parents must choose the names in the lists for their children. In Britain, some old-fashioned  names have become popular again, such as Maisie or Ella for a girl, and Alfie or Noah for a boy. But the most popular names are not the strange ones. The top names are very traditional--Jack and Thomas for boys, or Grace and Jessica f6r girls. ,,. (5,2,l0) According to the passage, which of the following names is NOT allowed?"
"Many children act in TV shows. They work several hours every day, so they cannot go to a regular school. How do they get an education?     In Hollywood, where many TV shows are made, about forty teachers give lessons for the children in the shows. They teach wherever their pupils are working.     They teacher's job is very important. She is responsible for making sure that the child works only the permitted hours each week. She is also responsible for making sure that the child learns the required subjects. She makes sure, too, that the child gets enough rest and play, along with his education.     Child actors are required to attend classes twenty hours each week. California law says that they must be taught from September to the middle of June. If they do not get good marks in school, they are not permitted to continue working in TV shows.     TV children are usually good pupils, and most of their teachers like this special kind of work. Their classes are held in many interesting places. Sometimes the""classroom""is a Mississippi riverboat. Sometimes it is the inside of a spaceship. Often the pupils become famous stars.

Let's say it's 4:17 p.m. and you're driving home (alone of course) after an unusually hard day on the job. Not only was the workload  extremely heavy, you also had a disagreement with your boss, and no matter how hard you tried, he just wouldn't see your side of the situation. You're really upset and the more you think about it, the more nervous you become. All of a sudden you start experiencing severe pain in your chest that starts to spread out into your arm and up into your  . You are only about five miles from the hospital nearest your home, unfortunately you don't know if you'll be able to make it that far. What can you do? You've been trained in CPR but the guy who taught the course didn't tell you how to perform it on yourself. Since many people are alone when they suffer a heart attack, this article seems in order. Without help the person whose heart stops beating properly and who begins to feel  has only about 10 seconds left before losing consciousness. However, these victims can help themselves by coughing repeatedly and very powerfully. A deep breath should be taken before each cough, and the cough must be deep and last long, as when producing  from deep inside the chest. A breath and a cough must be repeated about every two seconds without stopping until help arrives, or until the heart is felt to be beating normally again. Deep breaths get oxygen into the  and coughing movements squeeze  the heart and keep the blood circulating. The squeezing pressure on the heart also helps it regain normal rhythm . In this way, heart attack victims can get to a phone and, between breaths, call for help. Now, do you understand the whole matter? Tell as many other people as possible about this. It could save their lives! We can learn from the passage that    _    ."
"The library is one of the most popular places at a western university.Students turn to it for research,conversations about class,and many other services. Compared with Chinese libraries,college libraries in the US and UK tend to offer more resources.A postgraduate at Yale University can borrow as many as 225 books at a time. In addition to borrowing books,there are online and electronic resources.These include a database search of popular and academic material,such as LexisNexis Academic,which offers items from newspapers and magazines. Although books and articles are the items that students ask for most frequently,some libraries provide audio and video recordings,maps and sheet music .At some schools,teachers and tutors put electronic copies of their teaching PPTs on the library web to give easier access for students. Another useful service in western college libraries is the Interlibrary Loan.This allows a student at one school to borrow books from another school.The loan request is made through the student's college library,which gets the book,gives it to the user,and arranges for its return. Technology has brought more services to students and has made libraries attractive.Some universities have services for students to send messages through the computer or mobile texts to ask the library staff for information. Earlier this year,Harvard University introduced a new Scan and Deliver service,allowing students to make requests for parts of books and articles.Requests made through the system are handled by library staff.The student receives an email with an Internet link to the scanned pages.The service is free and all material comes within four days. It used to be that libraries didn't allow food or drinks.But that rule is changing and many of them now contain a cafe so students can spend as much time as they want in the library.

"Tragedy struck for brothers Rob and Paul Forkan when they lost their parents in the 2004 Asian tsunami. Now, over ten years later, they're using their flip flop business to help other orphans. The boys had an unusual childhood. They were just 11 and 13 when their parents, Kevin and Sandra, took them out of the UK education system and moved the family to Goa in India. Their parents were of the philosophy that they would receive a healthier and fuller education by traveling the world and helping others. There they did lots of voluntary work and mixed with the local community. It was when the family were on holiday in Sri Lanka that the tsunami hit. Although the children managed to escape, their parents tragically couldn't. But Paul says their upbringing meant they were able to cope with this tough blow. ""Our parents gave us this confidence that we could do anything, that nothing was hard to achieve,"" says Paul. What the boys did was to start a business selling ethically-sourced sandals. They're called 'Gandys' after the father of India's independence movement, Mahatma Gandhi. ""He was in all our schoolbooks as kids; he's on all the money over in India;  he's famous for wearing his flip flops,"" says Paul. The entire project was inspired by their parents' philosophy, their globetrotting childhoods and what happened to them in Sri Lanka. Their parents had previously worked in the fashion industry before quitting their jobs and focusing on humanitarian projects. Thus, Gandys is a very fitting tribute to their lives. Gandys sells flip-flops and donates 10 percent of the profits from every pair sold to orphans around the globe. In conjunction with Gandys, the Forkans also founded Orphans for Orphans, a charitable organization dedicated to helping orphans. They say they can make a profit and do good at the same time: they give 10% of their profit to charity, and have set up their own foundation through which they've been able to open a children's home in Sri Lanka. This year alone, Gandys has sold 250,000 pairs of flip flops, which is only expected to increase. In 2013, the business made around 1.2 million pounds ($1.8 million). With more profits, more orphans will receive assistance. Hence, it's safe to say that the Forkan brothers are making their parents very proud. What can best describe the brothers?"

"While we are still children ,most of us live at home with our parents, more or less peacefully . But as we become teenagers , things change ,and we begin to grow apart from our parents . This means we are almost ready to leave the house where we grew up and make a new home of our own . All humans must do this ,but they don't all do it in the same way . If ,for instance ,you belong to a primitive tribe   ,then as you grew up ,you'd learn the skills you needed as an adult---how to catch fish ,how to keep the house and look after children . You would be ready to marry in your early teens and you would build a house and live near your family in the village. This seems a very old way of life , but it is what humans have been used to through hundreds of years. And it is what we are still used to in the 21stcentury ,for man hasn't changed in the short time since he became civilized . But could you leave home and look after yourself during the teen years ? Most people would not do very well . Why ? Because although man hasn't changed very much , the society he lives in has changed greatly ,which means that we have to learn more and more before we are ready to leave our parents' shelter(  ) and live alone . However ,sometimes it is very frustrating to live at parents' home . Parents can be very upset about late nights ,criticizing friends and always saying that we are noisy and dirty . But we still need our emotional   shelter till we finish our studies , and that is why we usually stay in our parents' home until we feel grown up enough to deal with living alone .

Ping-Pong Ping-pong is the national sport of China, so how could I know nothing about it? My father is a ping-pong fan, and a really good player. He's won several informal   matches. My relationship with ping-pong has always been on-and-off. I'll get into it for a while, and then lose interest. The reason is because I can't find a good partner. Some stronger can depress you, while someone weaker (or just as weak) can make the game boring. Tae Kwon Do   I've recently decided to try tae kwon do as my regular exercise activity. There's a story behind this choice: A few weeks ago, I was sitting on a bus, concentrating on a book. Suddenly, the bus became very quiet except for the sound of a woman's crying.

It was quite right to employ a similar matter that linked demographic growth to "" a long, thin power fuse that burns steadily from time to time until it finally reaches the limit, and explodes"". To understand the current situation, which is characterized by rapid increases in population, it is necessary to understand the history of population trends. Rapid growth is a comparatively recent phenomenon. Looking back at the 8,000 years of demographic history. We find that population have been really stable or growing very slightly for most of human history. For most of our ancestors, life was hard, often nasty, and very short. For most of human history, it was seldom the case that one in ten persons would live past forty, where infancy and childhood were especially risky periods. Often, societies were in clear danger of extinction because death rates could exceed their birth rates. Thus, the population problem throughout most of history was how to prevent extinction of the human race. This pattern is important to know. Not only does it put the current problems of demographic growth into a historical perspective, but it suggests that the cause of rapid increase in population in recent years is not a sudden enthusiasm for more children, but an improvement in the conditions that traditionally have caused high rate of death. Demographic history can be divided into two major periods: a time of long, slow growth which extended from about 8000B.C. till approximately 1650 A.D. And a period of rapid growth since 1650. In the first period of some 9,600 years, the population increased form some 8 million to 500 million in 1650. Between 1650 and the present, the population has increased from 500 million to more than 4 billion. And it is estimated that by the year 2020 there will be 8 billion people throughout the world. One way to appreciate this dramatic difference in such abstract numbers is to reduce the time frame to something that is more manageable. Between 8000B.C. and 1650, an average of only 50,000 persons was being added annually to the world's population each year. At present, this number is added very six hours. The increase is about 80,000,000 persons annually. The reason for a rapid growth of population lies in the fact that   _  ."
"Antonia left Athens and came to America to make her fortune. She wanted to be a famous actress, so she went to live in Hollywood, California. At first, Antonia had very little money, so she was forced to watch every penny while  _ of movie agents' offices. For over a year, she worked only in small parts. She found life extremely hard. She had to take buses or walk everywhere, and she ate only one meal a day. Even though she worked nights as a waitress, Antonia could not really make ends meet. Suddenly, one day, the star of a film became ill, and the director asked Antonia to take the part. Her acting was superb. After the first show of the film, she became an overnight success. Everyone gave her mad notice, and she received many offers for future starring roles. Since then, Antonia has changed her whole way of life. Now she wears expensive furs and drives a Rolls-Royce. She lives in a twenty-seven room house in Beverly Hills, with seven servants. All her needs are cared for. For Antonia, America is truly the land of streets paved with gold.

"People in cities all over the world shop in supermarkets. Who decides what you buy in the supermarket? Do you decide? Does the supermarket decide? When you enter the supermarket, you see shelves full of food. You walk in the aisles   between the shelves. You push a shopping cart and put your food in it. You probably hear soft, slow music as you walk along the aisles. This may be an attempt to please you, so you will enjoy shopping. Some supermarkets want to increase their profits by playing soft and slow music, because the slow music makes you walk slowly and you have more time to buy things. Fresh fruit and vegetables are usually put near the entrance. When you arrive at the supermarket, you think about the kinds of fruit and vegetables you need first. Once you've got that out of the way, you can relax and do the rest of the shopping without any hurry. Besides, if you see fresh goods first, it gives you a ""feel good"" impression of freshness, so you can not help spending your money. Maybe you go to the meat department then. There is some meat on sale, and you want to find it. The manager of the supermarket knows where customers enter the meat department. The cheaper meat is at the other end of the meat department, away from where the customers enter. You have to walk past all the expensive meat before you find the cheaper meat. Maybe you will buy some of the expensive meat instead of the meat on sale. Most of the food in supermarkets is very attractive. It all says ""Buy me quickly!"" to the customers. The fresh fruit and vegetables say ""Buy me quickly!"" as you walk by. The expensive meat says ""Buy me quickly!"" The supermarket tells you what to buy.

The next day, I got a text message apologizing and saying that I had been left out because their friend who addressed the notes must have missed me!(Miss Manners, they didn't even address the notes themselves!)It was accompanied by a picture of the thank-you note, which was texted to me with- the message, ""Here is a thank you just for you.

"A good teacher is many things to many people. In my own experience, the people I respect the most and think about the most are the teachers who demanded   the most discipline   from their students. I miss one teacher in particular that I had in high school. I think she was a good teacher because she was a very strict person. I remember very vividly   a sign over her classroom door. It was a simple sign that said, ""Laboratory--in this room the first five letters of the word was emphasized  , not the last seven."" In other words, I guess, labor for her was more important than oratory, which means making speeches. She prepared her work very carefully and demanded us to do the same. We got lots of homework from her. Once she had broken her arm, and everybody in the class thought that maybe the homework load would be reduced, but it continued just the same. She checked our work by stamping her name at the bottom of the papers to show that she had read them. I think sometimes teachers who demand the most are liked the least. But as time goes by, this discipline really seems to benefit   the students. Which of the following is considered a good teacher by the writer?"
"Several months ago I decided it would be wise to look into the possibilities of buying a life insurance policy , because I understood it might be a good investment. I got the name of an insurance agent from a friend and called the agent to get some information. From the kinds of questions I put to him the agent could tell that I knew nothing about insurance, so he kindly offered to explore the matter with me in more detail---to help me determine the kind of policy I ought to be considering. That evening he appeared at my door promptly  at 7:30; without wasting time on pleasantness, he spread his papers out on the kitchen table and launched into a lengthy explanation. I listened attentively as he talked about the difference between various types of policies, and he explained the kind of coverage he felt I ought to have. Toward the end of the evening (after three or four hours of talking), he kindly helped me fill out an application for a $50,000 policy, and then he asked if I could go to a Dr. Luther's office on Friday for a physical examination. I don't know why, but it was not until the mention of the doctor's appointment that I realized fully what was happening. I was about to sign a lifetime contract, yet I had not really made a decision about whether I wanted to buy the policy. However, since he had spent so much time with me, I didn't want to make him feel that he had wasted his time. So I invented an excuse about things I had to do on Friday, and I assured him I would call him in a few days. Actually, I had no intention of going to see Dr. Luther or of calling the agent again. I wanted to forget the whole thing. It's been over three months now since our meeting, and my friendly insurance agent still calls at my office faithfully two or three times a week. My secretary knows that I don't want to talk to him, so when he calls she tells him that I'm in a meeting or that I'm out of the office or that I'm away on a business trip. I realize now that it was a mistake not to tell him that first night that I didn't want the policy. Since I still can't bring myself to tell him clearly that I'm not interested, and please not to bother me anymore, all I can do is avoid his calls and hope I don't run into him some place.

"As they migrate  , butterflies and moths choose the winds they want to fly with, and they change their body positions if they start floating in the wrong direction. This new finding suggests that insects may employ some of the same methods that birds use for traveling long distances. Scientists have long thought that insects were simply at the mercy of the wind. Fascinating as their skills of flight are, migrating behavior has been difficult to study in   insects because many long distant trips happen thousands of feet above ground. Only recently have scientists developed technologies that can detect   such little creatures at such great heights. To their surprise, though, the insects weren't passive travelers on the winds. In autumn, for example, most light winds blew from the east, but the insects somehow sought out ones that carried them south and they positioned themselves to navigate directly to their wintering homes. Even in the spring, when most winds flowed northward, the insects didn't always go with the flow. If breezes weren't blowing in the exact direction they wanted to go, the insects changed their body positions to compensate  . Many migrating birds do the same thing. The study also found, butterflies and moths actively flew within the air streams that pushed them along. By adding flight speeds to wind speeds, the scientists calculated that butterflies and moths can travel as fast as 100 kilometers an hour. The findings may have real-world applications. With climate warming, migrating insects are growing in number. Knowing how and when these pests move could help when farmers decide when to spray their crops. It is not easy to study the migrating behavior of the insects because   _  ."

"The name might sound like that of a superhero, but Pooperman's task is much more basic. He, or she, is trying to shame the irresponsible dog owners of Lincoln into cleaning up behind their pets. Pooperman sticks notes into dog waste that owners have failed to clean up, warning them not to do it again. The typed notes read, ""Don't leave it. You might be the one who steps in it the next time you walk this way."" While welcoming the purpose of the message, local government officers have _ Pooperman for producing even more rubbish. They say they would prefer it if people told them when there was a problem rather than adding to the rubbish problem. The city of Lincoln government's environmental officer, Tony Garner, said, ""The public can help instead by observing dog owners to make sure they clean up after their pets, perhaps asking them to remove the waste if they try to leave it."" ""If this doesn't work we can take action -- people can tell us who the owner is, give us a description of the owner and the dog, or simply tell us when and where they allow their dog to produce the waste."" ""We can then focus our patrols  and take action against irresponsible owners."" Sue Grace, a dog owner from Birchwood, Lincs, said, ""I always clean up after my dog.

But in the morning when you wake up, they are remembered just as a dream. That is what happened to me.  I always had the dream to dance like a beautiful ballerina turning around and around and hearing people applaud for me. When I was young, I would turn around and around in the fields of wildflowers that grew in my backyard. Reality woke me up when I heard someone saying, ""I don't know why you bother trying to dance. Ballerinas are pretty and slender  girls. Besides, you don't have the talent to even be a ballerina."" I remember how those words hurt every feeling in my body. I fell to the ground and wept for hours.   I enjoyed hanging out by the water. I would sit there for hours and stare at my reflection . There I was, looking nothing like a pretty ballerina dancer.

"New York is a very large city with 8 million people. How do so many people move about the city on their way to work and school? So, we should know something about its transportation. In New York you can travel about the city by subway, bus, taxi and car. The subway runs on the railroad lines under the city. It crosses the city at different points and goes all parts of the city. Traveling by subway is the fastest way to get around the city. The second way to travel around the city is by public bus. It's a slower way to travel. This is because the bus moves in road traffic which is often heavy. You can also travel around the city by taxi. This is the most expensive way, but the taxi will take you to the very place you wish to go to. If traffic is heavy, the taxi will be slow. During the mornings and afternoons, this is the ""rush hour"". This is the time when the traffic is very heavy with people going to and from work. The last way to get around   New York is using your own car. However , it's not easy for you to drive, especially when you are driving in the ""rush hour"".

"In the Arctic Ocean waters live the social animals---belugas, which is also known as white whales. Highly intelligent, these whales use different sounds to communicate and find their way. Belugas are also among the smallest kinds of whales. More than 210 belugas, including 31 in the United States, live in aquariums   around the world. The Georgia Aquarium has asked for permission to bring 18 more belugas into the U.S. The whales were caught off the coast of Russia. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is considering the aquarium's request thoroughly. A law called the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) says the animals can only be brought into the country and put on display if they are caught without being hurt and there is an educational reason for doing so. Georgia Aquarium officials say the 18 belugas will help people learn more about the species and allow scientists to better understand how to protect it. The aquarium would also breed the whales so the U.S. aquariums can continue to display them. ""When we can study and observe, we gain a better understanding of their biology and diseases that affect them, and learn how to aid populations in their natural habitats,"" says William Hurley, Georgia Aquarium's chief officer. ""Much of this research would be impossible in the remote locations and extreme climates where the animals live."" The Georgia Aquarium would own the 18 belugas and would rent some to aquariums across the country. Meanwhile, many scientists, including Lori Marino, a whale expert, feel strongly that the whales belong in the ocean, not in tanks. These scientists say the whales are being used for entertainment and not for education, and having them in aquariums is not necessary for the species to survive. Marino said, ""Not only is it unfair to the belugas but there is no educational value in putting these whales on display."" What can we learn about belugas?"
"Sports can help you keep fit and get in touch with nature.However,whether you are on the mountains,in the waves,or on the grassland,you should be aware that your sport of choice might have great influence on the environment. Some sports are resource-hungry.Golf,as you may know,eats up not only large areas of countryside,but also tons of water.Besides,all sorts of chemicals and huge amounts of energy are used to keep its courses in good condition.This causes major environmental effects.For example,in the dry regions of Portugal and Spain,golf is often held responsible for serious water shortage in some local areas.

"What looks like a black hole, behaves like a black hole, but is bigger than a black hole? Two black holes! Astronomers last week discovered a pair of enormous black holes far out in the galaxy that appear to be dancing toward each other. However, astronomers say the collision is not likely to occur for several million years. Black holes are objects in outer space that are so dense that nothing can escape their gravity. They often sit in the center of a galaxy -- like the Milky Way --and suck up everything near them. The gravitational pull of a black hole is so intense that not even light (Which travels faster than anything else in space) can make it past without being swallowed. Black holes, like the one at the center of the Milky Way, are enormous. Scientists call some of them ""supermassive"", because they can be a few million times the size of most stars. Their size, their mass, and their inescapable gravity make black holes a giant force of nature in outer space. Because there is no light near black holes, astronomers cannot actually see them; they are completely invisible to us on the Earth. Scientists manage to detect the existence of a black hole by watching what happens to other objects, or matter floating in space. So how did scientists manage to get a good look at a region so faraway? The team used an orbiting NASA observatory known as Chandra. This special observatory uses X-rays rather than light to watch far out into space. Right before a star gets sucked into a black hole, it produces a large number of X-rays. Which is the latest space discovery about black holes?"
"Here is an astonishing and signficant fact:Mental work alone can't make us tired. It sounds absurd. But a few years ago, scientists tried to find out how long the human could labor without reaching a stage of fatigue . To the amazement of these scientists, they discovered thett blood passing through the brain, when it is active, shows no fatigue at all! If we took a drop of blood from a day labourer, we could find it full of fatigue toxins  and fatigue products. But if we took blood from the brain of Albert Einstein, it would show no fatigue toxing at the end of the day. So far as the brain is concerned, it can work as well and swiftly at the end of eight or even twelve hours f efforts as at the beginning. The brain is totally tireless. So what makes us tired. Some scientists declare that most of our fatigue come from our mental and emotional  attitudes. One of England's most outstanding scientists. J. A. Hadfield,says,""The greater part of the fatigue from which we suffer is of mental origin. In fact,fatigue of purely physical origin is rare."" Dr. Brill, a famous American scientist, goes even further. He declares,""One hundred percent of the fatigue of a sitting worker in good health is due to emotional problems."" What kinds of emotions make sitting workers tired?Joy?Satifaction?No!A feeling of being bored,anger,anxiety,tenseness,worry,a feeling of nt being appreciated---those are emotions that tire sitting workers.Hard work by itself seldom causes fatigue.We get tired because our emotions produce nervousness in the body.

Everyone will enjoy a longer life. Sun Wei:  Robots will be more popular. They will do what people don't want to do. We'll build new homes on other planets. By then, I'll be sixty years old. Zhang Lan:  By the year of 2050, cloning will have been used in many ways. It will bring back animals which disappeared many years ago. There will be no pollution.

"First lady Michelle Obama turns 50 on Friday, Jan. 17, 2014. Michelle Obama has spent the first half-century of her life breaking barriers and checking off a series of firsts. Now, as she reaches her milestone birthday Friday, the nation will be watching to see in what other areas she will leave her mark. Five years after moving into the White House, and without a re-election campaign to worry about, she has more room to relax in her role and, political watchers say, possibly become more vocal   on political issues in the three years left in office. So far, critics have complained about Michelle's silence on issues where they expected to hear her voice: Last year, at the start of her husband's second term, she disappointed advocates for tighter gun-control measures after she failed to push harder on the issue in response to the massacre   at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. She also disappointed some feminists   who wanted her to defend their causes instead of falling back on her self-described role as the nation's ""mom-in-chief."" Nor did she handle racial issues during her second term, as some had expected. ""The most important thing to remember is, whether you are black, white or Hispanic, you're the first lady and the president of all the people in the United States. That's a huge melting pot, so to reinforce  that she's African American over anything else would not be wise,"" said Anita McBride, who directs programming and national conferences on the legacies   of America's first ladies and their historical influence at American University. Valerie Jarrett, a top White House adviser and a close friend of the Obamas, said the first lady doesn't want to "" _ "" ""She really wants to have a maximum impact and to do that in fewer areas,"" Jarrett told the Associated Press. ""That, she said, ""is better than trying to take on every single possible cause."" But Robert Watson, a Lynn University professor, said he expects Obama to ""go a little harder at issues"" over the next several years. ""Second-term first ladies usually feel more at ease to speak more forcefully about issues close to their heart,"" he said. Myra Gutin, a Ryder University communications professor and frequent lecturer on first ladies, said she expects Obama to continue making both of them a priority in her remaining years in the White House, given their success. Michelle launched the ""Let's Move"" campaign in 2010. It in particular has gained widespread support, ranging from the National Football League to the Sesame Street franchise  , which even gave permission to the produce industry to use its licensed characters for free on fruits and vegetables. ""There's no such thing as a traditional first lady, not anymore in this technology-filled world. Is Mrs. Obama cutting edge? Is she an activist? No. As first ladies go, I think she's been politically careful because she does not want there to be a major flare-up that would require her husband to use his political capital to clean up,"" she said. ""But she's not exactly just sitting in the White House pouring tea and having receptions, either."" According to the professors or advisers, which of the following statements is NOT true?"

"Many years ago in a small German town, a Jewish businessman had the misfortune of owing a large sum of money to the moneylender. The moneylender, who was old and ugly, fancied the businessman's beautiful daughter. So he proposed a bargain. The moneylender told them that he would put a black pebble and a white pebble into an empty bag. The girl would then have to pick one pebble from the bag. If she picked the black pebble, she would become the moneylender's wife and he would _ her father's debt. If she picked the white pebble, she need not marry him and her father's debt would still be forgiven. But if she refused to pick a pebble, her father would be thrown into jail. They were standing on a pebble-strewn path. As they talked, the moneylender bent over to pick up two pebbles. The sharp-eyed girl noticed that he had picked up two black pebbles and put them into the bag. He then asked the girl to pick a pebble from the bag. No doubt she was caught in a dilemma. What would you have done if you were the girl? Careful analysis would produce three possibilities: 1.The girl should refuse to take a pebble. 2.The girl should know that there were two black pebbles in the bag and expose the money-lender as a cheat. 3.The girl should pick a black pebble and sacrifice herself in order to save her father from his debt and imprisonment. The above story is used with the hope that it will make us appreciate the difference between lateral  and logical thinking. Read on... The girl put her hand into the moneybag and drew out a pebble. Without looking at it, she fumbled and let it fall onto the pebble-strewn path where it immediately became lost among all the other pebbles. ""Oh, how clumsy of me!"" she said. ""But never mind, if you look into the bag for the one that is left, you will be able to tell which pebble I picked."" Since the remaining pebble is black, it must be assumed that she had picked the white one. And since the moneylender dared not admit his dishonesty, the girl changed what seemed an impossible situation into an extremely advantageous one. Which of the following indicates lateral thinking?"
"Fire fighting is a serous matter, knowing what to do during a fire can save people's lives. It is important to know the ways you can use and show them to everyone else in the family, such as stairways and emergency exits, but not elevators. From the lower floors of building, escape through windows is possible. Learn the best way to get out from a window with the least chance of serious injury. The second floor window is usually not very high from the ground. An average person, hanging by the fingertips will have a drop of about 6 feet to the ground. It is about twice the height of an average man. Of course, it is safer to jump a short way down than to stay in a burning building. Windows are also useful when you are waiting for help. Be sure to keep the door closed before opening the window. Otherwise, smoke and fire may be drawn into the room. Keep your head low at the window to be sure you get fresh air rather than smoke that may have leaked into the room. On the second or third floor, the best windows for escape are those which open onto a roof. From the roof a person can drop to the ground more safely. Dropping onto cement might end in injury. Bushes and trees can help you to have a soft landing. Which of the following should not be used when trying to escape from a fire?"

"There are no exact differences between physics and other natural sciences because all sciences overlap .In general,however,physics is the scientific study of forces and qualities such as heat,light,sound,pressure,gravity and electricity,and the ways they affect other objects. One major branch of physics deals with the states of matter--solids,liquids and gases and with their motions.The pioneer achievements of Galileo,Kepler and Newton dealt with solid masses of matter in motion.Such studies deal with forces acting on moving objects.It is the subject of mechanics and belongs to the branch of mechanics called dynamics,the study of matter in motion.This large topic includes not only the motions of stars and ping-pong balls but also the motions of the water pumped by a fire engine and those of the air passing through the jet engine of an airplane. A branch of mechanics is statics ,the study of matter at rest.The designs of buildings and bridges are examples of problems in statics.Other branches of physics are based on the different kinds of energy,which interact with matter.They deal with electricity and magnetism ,heat,light,and sound.From these branches of physics scientists find clues  which have revealed  the constructions of atoms and how the atoms react to various kinds of energy. _ is often called the basis of modern physics.Among the many subdivisions of modern physics are electronics and nuclear physics.Physics is closely related to engineering.A person who uses knowledge of physics in solving everyday problems is often called an engineer.For example,electricity is one of the branches of physics;and an electrical engineer is a man who uses the ""natural laws"" of electricity to help in designing and electric generator .

"Our planet is home to about seven billion people. Since the 1990s, population experts have predicted the number would grow to nine billion before it begins to slow down and possibly decrease. But a new report predicts the world's population is likely to increase to almost 11 billion by 2100. Based on the most modern statistical tools, the new report makes use of government records and considers expert predictions, including death rates, birthrates and international migration, or people moving across borders. The report says during the rest of this century, Africa's population will grow from about 3.5 billion to 5.1 billion over the next 85 years John is director of the United Nations Population Division. He says that in the past, researchers thought population growth in Africa would be similar to that of other areas. They expected slower growth rates as birth control use became more widespread. But he says those ideas were wrong. ""The level of contraception use has continued to increase but slowly -- more slowly than expected, and birthrate therefore has been falling less rapidly than expected, and the population therefore continues to grow somewhat more rapidly than we expected.The new findings are based on a joint research project of the United Nations and the University of Washington. The researchers believe the population of Asia will reach five billion by 2050. That is up from the current 4.4 billion. And then begin to decline. The researchers also believe that North America, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean area will have a total population of below one billion. John says the pressure of feeding the rising population is likely to be less than that might be expected. ""The relatively good news is that the world has been winning the race between population growth and food production. If you look back historically over the last 50 years, certainly for the world as a whole and for many, most individual countries and regions, the increase in food production has outpaced the increase of population.||"" What can be inferred from the passage?"

"With its 190 million inhabitants, Brazil has the largest population in Latin America and ranks fifth in the world.  However, Brazil's population growth rate has dropped greatly and Brazilian women now have only 2.7 children on average. This achievement really becomes the envy of many other Third World countries. Brazil has become one of the developing world's great successes at reducing population growth-----but more by accident than design. While countries such as India have made joint efforts to reduce birth rates, Brazil has had a better result without really trying, says George Martine at Harvard. Martine  _ , among other things, soap operas(TV series) and installment  plans introduced in the 1970s. Both played an important, although indirect role in lowering the birth rate. Brazil is one of the world's biggest producers of soap operas. Globo, Brazil's most popular television network, shows three hours of soaps six nights a week, while three others show at least one hour a night. Most TV series are based on wealthy characters living the high life in big cities. ""Although they have never really tried to work in a message towards the problems of reproduction , they describe middle and upper class values-----not many children, different attitudes towards sex, women working,"" says Martine. ""They sent this image to all parts of Brazil and made people conscious of other patterns of behavior and other values, which were put into a very attractive package."" Meanwhile, the installment plans tried to encourage the poor to become consumers. ""This led to an enormous change in consumption patterns and showed that consumption was in contradiction with unlimited reproduction,"" says Martine. Soap operas are useful in lowering Brazil's birth rate because   _  ."

"Do you have a good memory? Maybe you remember better than all of your friends. But even if you have a short-term memory, it's better than a chimpanzee's , right? Well, you may be wrong. Tetsuro Matszawa, a scientist from Kyoto University, Japan has showed how chimps have far better memories than humans. ""We learn that chimps have great memories by doing tests,"" he told The Guardian ""You can do things to improve your memory."" How do chimps have better memories than us? Scientists tested four chimps and human volunteers. They showed them five numbers on a computer screen. Chimps and human volunteers had to remember the numbers correctly. But to make it hard, the numbers disappeared  after seven tenths of a second. Then they will reduce  the time to two tenths of a second. While humans began to make mistake after mistake, the young chimps still did very well. Why do they have better memories? We share 98.8 percent of our DNA with chimps. But during evolution , we lost some of our shared abilities. As humans learned new skills, like language, we had to lose some of our memory skills to make room in our brains. ""To get something, we had to lose something,"" said the scientist. Chimps need good memories to survive . When a chimp looks up at the big tree and pick a banana, he must remember where he saw it as he fights off competition from other animals. What did the scientist's study find?"
"No woman can be too rich or too thin. This saying often attributed to(...) the late Duchess   of Windsor represents much of the strange spirit of our times. Being thin is assumed as such a virtue. The problem with such a view is that some people actually attempt to live by it. I myself have fantasies of slipping into narrow designer clothes. Consequently, I have been on a diet for the better --or worse-- part of my life. Being rich wouldn't be bad either, but that won't happen unless an unknown   dies suddenly in some distant land, leaving me millions of dollars. Where did we go off the track? When did eating butter become a sin , and a little bit of extra flesh unappealing, if not unpleasant? All religions have certain days when people stop from eating and overeating is one of Christianity's seven deadly sins. However, until quite recently, most people had a problem getting enough to eat. In some religious groups, wealth was a symbol of probable high morals, and fatness a sign of wealth and well-being. Today the opposite is true. We have shifted to thinness as our new mark of virtue. The result is that being fat -- or even only somewhat overweight -- is bad because it implies a lack of moral strength. Our obsession with thinness is also fueled by health concerns. It is true that in this country we have more overweight people than ever before, and that in many cases, being overweight correlates with an increased risk of heart and blood vessel disease. These diseases, however, may have as much to do with our way of life and our high-fat diets as with excess weight. And the associated risk of cancer in the digestive system may be more of a dietary problem -- too much fat and a lack of fiber -- than a weight problem. The real concern, then, is not that we weigh too much, but that we neither exercise enough nor eat well. Exercise is necessary for strong bones and both heart and lung health. A balanced diet without a lot of fat can also help the body avoid many diseases. We should surely stop paying so much attention to weight. Simply being thin is not enough. It is actually dangerous if those who get (or already are) thin think they are automatically healthy and thus free from paying attention to their overall life-style. Thinness can be pure vain glory. In the eyes of the author, an odd phenomenon nowadays is that  _  ."

She's on call at the hospital in Kilmichael every day, and she gets little time with her sons, aged 3 and 3 months. But the country doctor doesn't complain about her job. It's the one she chose for herself 25 years ago while she was a fifth-grader in Kilmicahael. The daughter of two workers in a town that had produced only two other doctors, Poe might not have been expected to go to college at all, let alone medical school. But it was a challenge at first, being the town's first female and first black doctor. She even had patients who refused to see her at first. But a lot of those patients who were unwilling in the beginning are now some of her most favorite patients and have accepted her, finally. Many patients, in fact, now refuse to seek health care elsewhere. Though she's working at least 80 hours a week, Poe is sorry that she sometimes has to turn patients away.

"Dr. Jack M. Gwaltney, Jr. a professor at the University Of Virginia School Of Medicine infected six student volunteers with virus, the most common cause of colds. A few days later, when they were coughing and sneezing, he gathered 37 more people and divided them into three groups. Group 1 members spent three days and nights in the same room with one of the infected students, separated by a screen so they couldn't touch one another. Group 2 sat around a table while an infected volunteer talked, coughed and sang to them. Group 3 held hands with an infected student for ten seconds, and then touched their own noses or eyes. Although most scientists at the time, the mid-70s, believed colds were spread by virus-laden droplets spread through the air when infected people coughed or sneezed, Gwaltney suspected physical contact might play an important role. Sure enough, of the 15 people who had touched a student volunteer, 11 became infected--compared with only one of those who had been sitting at the table, and none who had spent three days and nights together. ""The best evidence we have is that hand-to-hand contact is the most efficient way of transmitting virus,"" says Gwaltney. The study was one of a series that helped establish Gwaltney's reputation as a leading authority. Dr. Robert Couch says, ""It would not be inappropriate to call him Mr. Common Cold."" When Gwaltney is asked how close scientists are to finding a cure, he replies: ""If you mean 'get rid of', I don't think we're going to be able to do that with cold viruses any time soon. But if you look in the dictionary, you'll see that 'cure' is explained as a successful treatment. And we're not just getting more effective at treating the symptoms  --we're getting at the root cause too. "" When Dr. Gwaltney gives a reply in the end of the passage, he means that  _  ."
"I've been living in China for a while -- long enough to observe the long-term deterioration   of my own native language abilities, as well as those of my fellow English speakers. This deterioration can take different forms, one of which is the non-standard usage of the words. Its source is, specifically, Chinese culture, and its target is native English speakers. Below I give some of the common ways that the Chinese environment strikes down the native speaker's linguistic competence   . Net bar: In Chinese, they're called """", This is fine. We generally call them ""Internet cafe"" in English. The Chinese seem to think that """" should be translated as ""net bar"" in English, and many careless foreigners have even been misled by this idea. Name card: In the English-speaking world, business people have lots of business meetings to discuss business. On these occasions, business people exchange specially printed pieces of paper known as business cards. In China everyone calls them ""name cards"", because in Chinese they are called """" and ""name card"" is a more direct translation . Bean curd. It's called ""tofu,"" OK! This English word comes from Chinese. I know all dictionaries sold in China will tell you """" is ""bean curd"" in English and that may represent the two characters nicely, but ""bean curd"" is more a definition than a comfortable translation. And yet some foreigners start saying ""bean curd"" rather than tofu. Deplorable  ! I think you see the pattern. The normal native way of saying something is replaced by a more unnatural way of saying it using other English words. If you've been living in China for a while and find yourself using all of these, you might be on dangerous ground. You're going to start making a fool of yourself back home. Look out! Resist Chinglish attempts at destroying your own command of your mother tongue! What is the main cause of the non-standard usage of the words by native English speakers?"

Luckily, we can see both predators and prey-predators  can live in peace in Zootopia finally. Anyway, Zootopia is a great piece of work with important life lessons: life's a little bit messy, and we all make mistakes;no matter what type of animal you are, change starts with you. So stick to your dream and work for it. You know, ""everything is possible."" Who loves to see the latest cartoon movie Zootopia?"
"As in the field of space travel, new technologies continue to appear in undersea exploration. They share a number of similarities with each other -- as well as some important differences. Manned submersibles  , like spaceships, must maintain living conditions in an unnatural environment. While a spaceship must simply be sealed against the vacuum space, a submersible must be able to bear extreme pressure if it is not to break up in deep water. In exploring space, unmanned vehicles were employed before astronauts. In undersea exploration, on the other hand, men paved the way, and only recently have unmanned remote-operated vehicles (ROVs) been put to use. One reason for this is that communicating with vehicles in orbit is much easier than talking to those underwater. A vacuum is an ideal medium for radio communications, but underwater communications are limited to much slower sound waves. Thus, most undersea vehicles -- particularly ROVs -- operate at the end of long ropes.  For a similar reason, knowing where you are undersea is much more difficult than in space. A spaceship's position can be located by following its radio signal, or by using telescopes and radar. For an undersea vehicle, however, a special network of sonar  devices must be laid out in advance on the ocean floor in the area of a dive to locate the vehicle's position. Though undersea exploration is more challenging than outer space in a number of respects, it has a distinct advantage: going to the ocean depths doesn't require the power necessary to escape Earth's gravity. Thus, it remains far less expensive. The purpose of the passage is   _  ."
"History is full of examples of leaders joining together to meet common goals. But rarely have two leaders worked together with such friendship and cooperation as American President Franklin Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. They both were born in wealthy families and were active in politics for many years. Both men loved the sea and the navy,history and nature. Roosevelt and Churchill first met when they were lowerlevel officials in World War One. But neither man remembered much about that meeting. However,as they worked together during the Second World War they came to like and trust each other. Roosevelt and Churchill exchanged more than one thousand seven hundred letters and messages during five and a half years. They met many times,at large national gatherings and in private talks. But the closeness of their friendship might be seen best in a story told by one of Roosevelt's close advisors,Harry Hopkins. Hopkins remembered how Churchill was visiting Roosevelt at the White House one day. Roosevelt went into Churchill's room in the morning to say hello. But the president was shocked to see Churchill coming from the washing room with no clothes at all. Roosevelt immediately apologized to the British leader for seeing him naked. But Churchill reportedly said: ""The Prime Minister of Great Britain has nothing to hide from the president of the United States."" And then both men laughed. The United States and Great Britain were only two of several nations that joined together in the war to resist Hitler and his Allies. In January,1942,twentysix of these nations signed an agreement promising to fight for peace,religious freedom,human rights,and justice. The three major Allies,however,were the most important for the war effort: the United States,Britain,and the Soviet Union. Yet,Churchill and Roosevelt disagreed about when  to attack Hitler in western Europe. And Churchill resisted Roosevelt's suggestions that Britain give up some of its colonies. But in general,the friendship between Roosevelt and Churchill,and between the United States and Britain led the two nations to cooperate closely. We can know from the passage that  _  ."
"When we are unfamiliar with something, we may feel nervous and fearful. The help of others is a good way to make us pull through.   I write for a big newspaper, and I wanted to write a story about parachute  jumping. To make it a realistic as well as exciting story, I decided that I first had to make a jump myself. Unfortunately, I am not good at any sport of any kind, let alone parachute jumping.   My friend Mr. Smith was willing to give me a hand. He took me to a ground school. The first day's training included several hours of instruction but not my first drop from an airplane. For this, I had to wait until the following morning.   The next morning, after a hurried, anxious breakfast, I was taken to the airfield. There, two heavy parachutes were put on my back. Then I was asked to make my way to a small plane which had just stopped slowly on the runway.   Once on the plane, it was soon climbing. I began to feel nervous. As we reached one thousand meters, Harry, my teacher, hooked  a line from my parachute to a steel ring inside the plane. The line was to pull my parachute open after I jumped.   ""Get ready, Henry,"" Harry said. I moved carefully to the door. I wanted to cry, ""No, no, no!"" but no word came.   ""Jump!"" Harry called out loudly. ""Jump!""   To my surprise, kicking like a frog, I did jump. Away from the plane, and down, down I fell. It worked! The air seemed to hold me up. I was very happy.    Then I felt a quick pull. My big parachute had opened! It was like the best surprise I'd ever had. I looked down. There were rivers, trees, fields and houses. I heard the soft sound of the air. This was fun! How did the writer feel after he jumped out of the plane?"
"Justin Bieber's birthday wish has come true. The teenage star announced earlier this week that he wanted his fans to donate $17,000 to charity---so far the total of gifts that have poured in is more than $31000. ""I have had a great year and it is all because of the fans helping me live my dream,"" said the young singer. ""I'm turning 17 years old on Tuesday, and have so much to be grateful  for! So this year, I really want my birthday to be all about helping others. Instead of asking for gifts, I'm asking friends, family and fans to consider donating $17 for my 17thbirthday to help make a change."" Bieber asked his fans to donate to a charity that builds clean water projects in developing countries. ""Together, we've made a big difference for many causes. Did you know that about 4,500 kids die each day from waterborne diseases  ? By building clean water projects for villages that need them, we can prevent this! I want to make my birthday matter this year--- let's make it so more kids can grow up to have a 17thbirthday like me. Join me to make a change. ""I'm really so grateful for my family, friends and fans--- and I believe we can do something big to help bring clean water to people in need. Even if you don't have $17 to give I just ask you to go out in your community and try and make a positive difference. Even the smallest act of kindness can go a long way."" ,.

"One of the main decisions you must make when traveling is deciding where to stay. A good place to stay can often make a holiday. Whether you are looking for a classy hotel or a night under the stars, we can guide you through your different options. Bed and Breakfast An English invention, bed and breakfasts offer exactly what they suggest, a bed for the night and breakfast in the morning. People who hate the anonymity of hotels but want more luxury than a hostel often choose to stay at bed and breakfasts. ""B&B's"", usually someone's private home, are often found in the countryside. Hostels For those traveling on a tight budget, hostels are the best accommodation option. Informal places usually with a friendly youthful vibe , they offer dormitory beds for rent. Bathrooms are usually down the hall. Remember to check reviews by previous guests online before you book your hostel. Couch Surfing An unusual but interesting option, couch surfing is a growing trend among young internationals. The idea is that you become a member of the online couch-surfing community (www. couchsurfing. com) and then when you travel, look up other members in that country and ask to stay on their couch  . Most hosts will suggest sightseeing trips and take you out in the evening, making it a great way to see things that aren't in your guidebook. And remember, it may be free but don't forget to offer to buy your host a drink or dinner. Camping Sleeping under the stars! For budget travelers staying at camping grounds is the cheapest way to travel. The drawback is that you have to carry a tent with you. Camping grounds can be found across Europe, America and Australia. However, if you intend on camping in busy cities, check first where the nearest campsite is. More often than not, they are on the outskirts, which can mean lengthy bus rides into town when you want to eat or see the sights. Hostels are popular among budget travelers because they provide    _  ."
"I made a promise to myself on the way down to the vacation beach cottage. For two weeks I would try to be a loving husband and father. Totally loving. No ifs, ands or buts. The idea had come to me as I listened to a talk on my car radio. The speaker was quoting a Biblical passage about husbands and their wives. Then he went on to say, ""Love is an act of will. A person can choose to love."" To myself, I had to admit that I had been a selfish husband. Well, for two weeks that would change. And it did. On arriving at the beach cottage, I kissed Evelyn meeting me at the door and said, ""That new yellow sweater looks great on you."" ""Oh, Tom, you noticed"", she said, surprised and pleased. Maybe a little puzzled. After the long drive, I wanted to sit and read. Evelyn suggested a walk on the beach. I started to refuse, but then I thought, ""Evelyn's been alone here with the kids all week and now she wants to be alone with me."" We walked on the beach while the children flew their kites. So it went. Two weeks of not calling the Wall Street firm where I am a director; a visit to the shell museum though I usually hate museums. Relaxed and happy, that's how the whole vacation passed. I made a new promise to keep on remembering to choose love. There was one thing that went wrong with my experiment, however. Evelyn and I still laugh about it today. On the last night at our cottage, preparing for bed, Evelyn stared at me with the saddest expression. ""What's the matter?"" I asked her. ""Tom,"" she said in a voice filled with distress, ""I don't?"" ""What do you mean?"" ""Well...that checkup I had several weeks ago...our doctor...did he tell you something about me? Tom, you've been so good to me...am I dying?"" It took a moment for it all to be understood. Then I burst out laughing. ""No, honey,"" I said, wrapping her in my arms. ""You're not dying; I'm just starting to live."" From the story we may infer that Tom drove to the beach cottage   _  ."
"My grandmother Adele loved culture and was generous with its gifts. When I was a child, she took me to museums, restaurants, dances. She showered me with gifts from her travels around the world. But I can only remember her giving me one book--a book that, to this day, I have not read. She presented me with her own favorite childhood book: Hans Brinker. My grandmother was happy to share this book with me. She even decorated the title page with her proud writing. I tried to read it. I adored reading, and would dive into a new pile of books from the library all at once. But something about Hans Brinker just wouldn't let me in. The story was set in Holland, a long time ago. It felt dull and unfamiliar--even though I was a fan of classics of other times and places. I simply read the first pages over and over. I could not progress. Standing on a bookshelf in our living room, the book was like something I avoided. It scolded me for not being interested, for not trying hard enough, for disappointing my grandmother. The book started to fit in, almost forgotten, until Adele asked. Had I read it? Did I like it? Always determined, she wanted to know the answer. I would make some kind of excuse, feel bad, and open it again, hoping for a new reaction. _ . Years passed and finally Adele and I both accepted that I would never read Hans Brinker. Eventually I cleared the book from the shelf. The Hans Brinker experience led me to set a rule that I've lived by ever since: Do not ask about a book given as a gift. Don't ask, despite your desire to discuss it to grow closer. The desire for such connection is what gives book-giving with special meaning--and increases the owner's possibility to be a letdown. Guilt is basically the same as for all gifts, though. If the giver doesn't have the pleasure of seeing or hearing about the gift being enjoyed, and asks whether it is, then the owner--unless she can truthfully say ""yes""--either has to admit to not liking the present, or else lie on the spot. Neither is pleasant. So, don't ask. When the author was a kid, his grandmother   _  ."
"Kids love the all-knowing Google. Your kids likely use Google to help them find everything from information for homework assignments, to funny cat videos, and everything in between. Sometimes kids can take a ""wrong turn"" on Google and end up in a dark part of the Internet where they shouldn't be. Thankfully, Google has some parental control features that parents can implement to at least help reduce the volume  of crap  that ends up in search results,which can enable you to help keep your curious kids from ending up on the wrong side of the tracks. What is Google SafeSearch? Google SafeSearch is one of the primary parental control options offered by Google to help parents police search results. SafeSearch helps to filter explicit content out of search results. It is mainly designed to target sexually explicit material (images and videos) and not violent content. How to Enable Google SafeSearch?1. From the ""Search Settings"" preferences page, place a check in the box with the label ""Filter explicit results"". 2. To lock this setting so that your child can't change it, click the ""Lock SafeSearch"" link. If you are not already logged into your Google account, you will need to do so in order to lock SafeSearch to the ""on"" position. Enable SafeSearch on Mobile Devices. In addition to your computer, you will probably also want to enable SafeSearch on any mobile device that your child uses regularly. For instructions on how to enable SafeSearch on a variety of mobile devices, check out Google's SafeSearch Mobile support page.  As we all know, kids are going to be kids and try to test their boundaries. We put up one roadblock and they go around it. It's a constant cat and mouse game and there will always be some internet door that we as parents forget to lock, and that will be the one that the kids get through, but we do the best we can.

"Accidents often happen. It's necessary for us to remember these tips. On your way home or to school: Wait for the green traffic light, and look left and right before you cross the road. If you see a car coming, don't cross until it really stops. At school: Never run around too fast at school. When students around you begin to push, try to hold something.  If you fall down in a crowed   place, cover your head with both hands. When there's a fire: Keep quiet and leave quickly. Use a piece of wet cloth to cover your mouth and nose so that you don't breathe in smoke. If your clothes catch fire, drop to the ground and roll   from side to side to put out the fire. For eating: Wash fruit like apples or pears carefully before you eat it. And if your food looks or smells bad, don't eat it. About strange invitations: If an Internet friend asks to meet you, tell your parents about it. Don't go alone. How many tips does the passage tell us?"
"An ordinance of the city of Green requires that its mayor must have been continuously a resident of the city for at least five years at the time he or she takes office. Candidate, who is thinking about running for mayor in an election that will take place next year, will have been a resident of Green for only four and one-half years at the time the mayor elected then takes office. Before he decides whether to run for the position of mayor, Candidate wants to know whether he could lawfully assume that position if he were elected. As a result, Candidate files suit in the local federal district court for a declaratory judgment that the Green five-year-residence requirement is unconstitutional and that he is entitled to a place on his political party's primary election ballot for mayor. He names the chairman of his political party as the sole defendant but does not join any election official. The chairman responds by joining Candidate in requesting the court to declare the Green residence requirement invalid. In this case, the court should "
"Once there was a group of adventurers who went on an adventure in a place named Hyperion where there was a lot of snow. Their names were Thor, Bravos, and Pierre. Thor and Bravos were from Norway, but Pierre was from Paris, France. Because of where he was from, he wasn't used to the cold. To stay warm, Pierre wore three jackets. One day during their adventure the men saw a strange cave. Thor and Bravos wanted to go inside, but Pierre was afraid. He had heard that a horrible bug monster named Vlastos lived in the caves of Hyperion. Thor and Bravos told him that was only a fairy tale. They told him the only thing he really needed to worry about was hitting his head on a rock in the cave. Finally they got Pierre to go into the cave. Inside there were lots of tunnels. They chose the middle tunnel. The tunnel went down into the earth. After a long time it ended. The men were in a huge room. There were beautiful ice shapes on the walls. What did the adventurers find at the end of the tunnel?"

"Children's allowance. Many children first learn the value of money by receiving an allowance . The purpose is to let them learn from experience at an age when financial (;;)mistakes are not very costly. In any case, parents should make clear what the child is expected to pay for with the money. At first, young children may spend all of their allowance soon after they receive it. If so, they'll learn the hard way that spending must be done within a budget . Parents are usually advised not to offer more money until the next allowance. It is to show them that a budget demands choices between spending and saving. Many people who have written on the subject of allowances say it is not a good idea to pay your child for work around the home. These jobs are a normal part of family life. Paying children to do extra work around the house, however, can be useful. It can even provide an understanding of how a business works. Allowances give children a chance to experience what they can do with money. They can share it in the form of gifts or give it to a good cause. They can spend it by buying things they want. Or they can save it. Saving helps children understand that costly goals require sacrifice: They have to cut costs and plan for the future. Requiring children to save part of their allowance can also open the door to future saving and investing. Many banks offer services to help children learn about personal finance. By receiving an allowance, children can learn   _  ."
"It's a long-awaited day for China. The navy now has its first aircraft carrier , Liaoning. It's a unique experience to get to know the life in the carrier. The carrier is just like a small city on the sea. It has all the functions for daily life. There are 4 words to sum up its characters: big, small, much and high. The carrier Liaoning is such a huge one that the total length of the whole corridor could reach over 20 kilometers. But the living space for the sailors is quite small. That's because the carrier is designed for researching purposes, rather than comfortable living. Over 1,000 sailors, both men and women, are living onboard. They are arranged among over 3,000 tiny rooms below the deck.. For visitors, it's so easy to get lost. So the first thing the new sailors have to learn is their way around. The number of female sailors is much less than that of the males, taking about 5 percent of the total. But they play a key role in carrying out some special missions. Also, you will be surprised by the high level of education of today's sailors. The captain said that over 90 percent of the sailors are college graduates. Six hold Doctor's Degrees and 45 have a Master's. The whole team is young but vigorous. The complex work on the carrier requires high management abilities for the commanders onboard . Why is the living space for the sailors quite small?"
"Quick Service A man took a pair of shoes to a shoe repair shop and said to the shoemaker, ""I'd like you to repair these shoes for me, please."" ""Certainly, sir."" the shoemaker said.

"It is common sense that children who walk or cycle to school have a lower risk of obesity than those by car. But driving your youngsters to the gates could also cause their academic work to suffer. Researchers found children who were driven to school, or who took public transport, had poorer concentration levels than those who took a more active route such as walking or cycling. The joint study by researchers at two Danish universities found the regular exercise could advance a student up to half a year in their studies. Children who were driven to school, or who took public transport, performed less well in a test measuring concentration levels, than those who had walked or cycled. The results surprised the researchers, as their hypothesis  originally focused on the effects of eating breakfast and lunch on pupils' ability to concentrate. ""The exercise one uses to transport oneself to school is reflected in the level of concentration one has about four hours later,"" Niels Egelund, a co- author of the report said. ""The results showed that having breakfast and lunch has an impact, but not very much compared to having exercise."" ""As a third-grade pupil, if you exercise and bike to school, your ability to concentrate increases to the equivalent of someone half a year further in their studies,"" he added. In the survey, taken by 19, 527 pupils aged five to 19 years old, participants were asked about their exercise habits and were then given a basic test measuring their concentration. ""Most people know the feeling of being refreshed after having exercised, but it is surprising that the effect lasts for so long,"" Egelund said. Previous research from the university of Montreal has found that exercise helps our brains make better use of oxygen. It may also reduce mental fatigue  and sharpen your thinking in between gym sessions. And last week Swedish researchers said they found that muscular boys will live longer than their weaker friends. And even if they are overweight by the time they get to adulthood, those with stronger muscles tend to live longer. Children driven to school performed badly in their academies work in that_."

The Silk Road was not a simple trading network. It passed through thousands of cities and towns. It started from eastern China, across Central Asia and the Middle East, and ended in the Mediterranean Sea. It was used from about 200 B.C. to about A.D.1300, when sea travel offered new routes  . It was sometimes called the world's longest highway. However, the Silk Road was made up of many routes, not one smooth path. They passed through what are now 18 countries. The routes crossed mountains and deserts and had many dangers of hot sun, deep snow and even battles. Only experienced traders could return safe. The Silk Road got its name from its most prized product. Silk could be used like money to pay taxes or buy goods. But the traders carried more than just silk. Gold, silver, and glass from Europe were much found in the Middle East and Asia. Horses traded from other areas changed farming practices in China. Indian merchants traded salt and other valuable goods. Chinese merchants traded paper, which produced an immediate effect on the West. Apples traveled from centre Asia to Rome.

"When I was a boy I always wanted to be a cowboy. I remember my Mom worrying about me getting sick from the heat in the summer, because I wore a thick blue sweater all the time. No respectable cowboy, however, would wear short sleeves so I sweated while I played. One day my parents gave me a bb gun. It looked just like a gun that all the cowboys used in the movies. I spent hours each day during those summer months shooting at stumps and pretending to be John Wayne (film actor who played tough heroes). As I was coming into the house one afternoon, though, I tried it one time too many. The gun that I thought was empty let out a soft pop and a bullet flew across the room and parted the hair of my Dad who was asleep on the couch. My Dad took one look at the bb hole a half inch above his head, walked over to me, took my gun, walked outside, and calmly broke it in half. I didn't cry too much over this. I knew how close I had come to hurting my Dad with my stupidity. I didn't expect to ever get another bb gun either. That is why I was so surprised when my Dad bought me another one the next year. I guess he thought I had wised up enough to know how to use it this time. I never put a single bb in the new gun, but in my imagination John Wayne rode again. I eventually outgrew my cowboy stage, but I never did outgrow my appreciation for my Father's forgiveness. He showed me that even when I messed up in the worse way I was still loved. He gave me another chance and let me know that I was forgiven whether I deserved it or not. He shared with me some of the unconditional love and forgiveness. May we always embrace and share that love and forgiveness as well. How did the author feel when he received the first bb gun?"

""Be right over,"" the man said. The car came very quickly, and when she opened the front door, two policemen walked in. She knew them both--she knew nearly all the men at that precinct.

While she was talking, crying and talking, Noonan discovered a small patch of congealed blood on the dead man's head. He showed it to O'Malley who got up at once and hurried to the phone. Later, one of the detectives came up and sat beside her. Did she know, he asked, of anything in the house that could've been used as the weapon? Would she mind having a look around to see if anything was missing--a very big spanner, for example, or a heavy metal vase. They didn't have any heavy metal vases, she said. ""Or a big spanner  ?"" She didn't think they had a big spanner. But there might be some things like that in the garage. The search went on. She knew that there were other policemen in the garden all around the house. She could hear their footsteps on the gravel outside, and sometimes she saw the flash of a torchlight through a chink in the curtains. Then one by one they came in and were persuaded to take a little nip of whisky. They stood around rather awkwardly with the drinks in their hands, uncomfortable in her presence, trying to say consoling things to her. Sergeant Noonan wandered into the kitchen, came out quickly and said. ""Look, Mrs Maloney. You know that oven of yours is still on, and the meat still inside...I better turn it off for you, hadn't I?"" ""Will you do that, Jack. Thank you so much."" When the sergeant returned the second time, she looked at him with her large, dark, tearful eyes. ""Would you do me a small favour--you and these others?"" She said. ""We can try, Mrs Maloney."" ""Well,"" she said. ""You must be terribly hungry by now because it's long past your supper time. Why don't you eat up that lamb that's in the oven? It'll be cooked just right by now."" ""Wouldn't dream of it,"" Sergeant Noonan said. ""Please,"" she begged. ""Please eat it."" The four policemen _ , but they were clearly hungry, and in the end they were persuaded to go into the kitchen and help themselves. The woman stayed where she was, listening to them through the open door, and she could hear them speaking among themselves, their voices thick and sloppy because their mouths were full of meat. ""The guy must've used a big thing to hit Patrick,"" one of them was saying. ""The doctor says his skull was smashed all to pieces."" ""That's why it ought to be easy to find."" ""Exactly what I say."" ""The murderer's not going to carrying a thing like that around with him longer than he needs."" One of them belched. ""Personally, I think it's right here on the premises."" ""Probably right under our very noses. What you think, Jack?"" And in the other room, Mary Maloney began to giggle. Which of the following is incorrect according to the passage?"
"The first time we started using it, we thought it would just be a bit of fun, a one-time thing.  _ A _  ""Let's just give it a try,"" my fiancee said. I was a bit nervous, but I knew some of our friends were already into it, and they said it was fine and that I should relax because everyone was doing it.""OK,"" I agreed, convinced it would be harmless.  _ B _  Before long, we were using it once a week. Then it became twice a week. We went from using it after work to using it in the mornings, and then at lunchtime, too. Suddenly we reached a point where we were using it every day. Even when I wasn't using it, I was thinking about using it.  _ C _  That's when I realized the terrible truth. We couldn't stop. Dear readers, it shames me to admit it, but I am an addict of online shopping site Taobao. And I don't think I'm the only one.  _ D _  I see the telltale signs every where: People with bags under their eyes, clearly exhausted after staying up late browsing items they might one day need (but probably won't),like the 1940s leather aviator cap I bought in the event I ever need to become an aviator in the 1940s. I see co-workers furtively  sneaking down to the mailroom, eyes darting around suspiciously. I know what's going through your mind as you read this. ""This isn't me,"" you're thinking, ""I can stop anytime I want."" But can you? In China you can get same day delivery for just about anything you buy online. In Australia, my home country, the same item would take weeks to arrive. ""It's the convenience,"" I said to my fiancee. ""That's why we're hooked."" But is that convenience worth the risk of waking up one morning to discover you've been buried alive in masses of brand new women's shoes? In my case it's probably not, especially because I suspect my fiancee won't realize I'm missing until weeks later, when my credit card stops working and I've long since expired. So what can you do to battle this terrible addiction? Never fear, dear readers, because I've created a special five-step list to help you stop online shopping. Step one: Acknowledge you have a problem. Resist buying adult-sized, Star Wars Stormtrooper outfit on Taobao. You don't really need it. Step two: Try not to feel guilty about buying adult-sized, Star Wars Stormtrooper outfit on Taobao. Step three: Put the computer and smartphone away, get back to nature, and take a walk in the park. Step four: Try not to feel guilty about buying a new outfit for your walk in the park. I mean, it was  on sale, right? Step five: Buying a book on how to quit Taobao...from Taobao. On second thoughts, maybe don't listen to me, after all. The author concludes this passage with a tone of  _  ."

"Do you blank out or feel so nervous in exams that you have trouble writing answers to questions that you knew just last night? If so, you likely have a case of test anxiety. But, don't be afraid. By recognizing the problem, you are taking the first step towards overcoming it. Believe it or not, a touch of nervousness can sharpen your mind, allowing you to perform more quickly. This is because under stress, the body releases   the hormone adrenaline  , which prepares it for something important that will happen. However, too much anxiety can result in sleeplessness, loss of appetite before tests, and poor performance. Some people might feel hot and tired. With great anger they often shout or complain for no reason. If you worry a lot or are a perfectionist, you are more likely to have trouble with test anxiety. Those who have prepared poorly for a test or have had negative experiences taking tests may also experience test anxiety. When you feel a storm of anxiety coming on, stop what you're doing and make your mind a blank. If possible, actually tell yourself to 'STOP!' This will get your mind off the stress. Then think of being at a place of comfort and let your body relax. As you continue the test, find questions you know the answers to and answer them first. This will help restore your confidence. Important of all, talk to yourself using positive language. Make it a habit to replace each negative thought with a logical reason. For example: ""I've studied hard and I know the material, so I'm ready to do the best I can."" Another thing you can do is to learn to accept mistakes. In fact, they can be valuable learning opportunities. Last but not least, start test preparation early - three to five days ahead of the quiz or test. After all, good study habits and skills - for example, time management and note-taking - will give you the feeling that you are in control. The best title of the passage is probably  _"
"News one: As the pace of life in big cities is getting faster, people are looking for more ways to relax. Let's take a look at one way people are reducing stress in Beijing. The game is ""Room Escape"". ""Room Escape"" was originally a computer game. In recent years, it has been adapted to a real life game. There are more than 10 places in Beijing where people can play this game. According to the rules, the players are first taken to a house with several iron doors. They then need to find a way out of the house in one hour. Different houses have different ways of escaping, all of which require players' bold , careful thought, and teamwork. News two: The Chinese government has published a list of 24 guidelines  on how to take better care of parents. They are a modern update to 24 old stories about respectful children from the Yuan Dynasty. The guidelines list 24 things to do with parents, including giving them a call every week, teaching them to use the internet, and supporting single parents' remarriage. The guidelines stem from a Yuan Dynasty book, about 24 filial-hearted children who treated their parents very well. It is a value younger generations should never forget. What should we not do to our parents?"
"I have happy memories of trips to Europe, but my trip to Romania   was unique. When I was there as recalled, it was like being in a ""James Bond"" movie. My husband was born there, but his family sent him to study in Italy. Before he left, his mother told him, ""As long as I write in pencil, don't come back. When I write to you in pen, it's safe to return."" But she never wrote in pen. My husband lived a poor life in Italy. He applied to go to America, but there was a limit in number and he was rejected. He was accepted by Canada, though, and from Calgary he jumped onto a train to San Francisco. There he stayed --illegally. He became a US citizen when we got married. By then he was a charming European with a Romanian accent and the manners of a prince. With seven years' experience in America, a US passport, and two children later, he felt it was safe to visit Romania. He hadn't seen his mother, two sisters, and two brothers since he was sixteen. We flew to Munich, Germany; picked up the German-made car we had purchased in the States; and drove to Romania via Austria and Hungary. When we reached Bucharest, the capital city of Romania, his family was waiting outside his sister's house to greet us. After a long time of hugging, kissing, and crying, his family also hugged me, the American wife with two young children. They had great interest in me. Few Americans visited Romania at that time, and most Romanians had little chance to travel. I had brought an English-Romanian dictionary with me and managed to communicate, using only nouns, with no verbs. My Romanian improved, and the family's stock of English words increased, but mostly I spoke in broken, New York-accented Romanian. The sisters loved their gifts of skirts and purses, the brothers loved the radios, and the children loved the candy. We made side trips to the Black Sea and enjoyed sightseeing in beautiful mountains. Dining at outdoor cafes to the music of violins was fantastic with fancy flavor, but nothing was as special as family dinners. Romania didn't have many dry cleaners. Most homes had old-fashioned washing machines but no dryers, and it was a hot summer. My husband's relatives didn't want to risk dirtying their clothes. Their solution was as simple as it was shocking: the women only wore their bras  and slips   at dinner table. The men were eating without shirts. They all had jobs, so time was precious. Having dinner without proper clothes was a small inconvenience compared with the effort of washing clothes --at least in my husband's home, perhaps all across Romania. I, of course, having just met them, ate fully clothed. I washed my clothes by hand and hung them outdoors to dry. On the last night of our three-week stay, we had a large family dinner. I was tired of washing my clothes. So I pulled my dress over my head and placed it on the chair behind me. All men and women applauded for my action. Even with my poor Romanian, I understood that they were saying, ""She's part of our family now."" My children were 4 and 5 at the time, but they still have memories of that trip. They know how to say, ""Good morning."" and ""There are apricots   on the tree."" I can still say, ""Do you speak Romanian?""and ""I swim in the Black Sea."" But most of all, I remember sitting at a long dining-room table in my bra, enjoying meatballs with fresh garlic  . The writer was completely accepted by her husband's family when   _  ."

"The very great success in science just before and after the midpoint of the twentieth century has caused educators in the United States to realize that science teaching in the future must differ from science teaching in the past. During the past twenty years, science has played an important part in shaping the character of our civilization. The welfare, stability, and security of our nation and the continuation of a free society are closely related to the discoveries of science and the applications of these discoveries. The scientific revolution we are beginning to experience, together with the trend toward world industrialization, demands a program of science education with new emphasis, purpose, and content. Simply knowing about the existence of the scientific enterprise is not enough for effective citizenship. Young people need to understand how our society depends upon scientific and technological advancement and to realize that science is a basic part of modern living. The scientific process and the knowledge produced cannot be considered to be  _ in themselves, except for the classic scientists. A student should understand the relation of basic research to applied research, and the connection between technological developments and human affairs. More of technology than science will be involved in social decisions, but both are important in public policy. The knowledge and methods of science are of little importance if there is no inclination(,) to use them properly. An open mind, a desire for accurate  knowledge, confidence in the procedures for seeking knowledge, and the expectation that the solution of problems will come from the use of tested and proven knowledge are among the ""scientific attitudes"". Science instruction should acquaint  students with career possibilities in technical fields and in science teaching. A continuous effort should be made to identify and encourage those who develop special interests. They should be given opportunities for some direct experience of a professional nature; they should also learn about the extent of the various science fields and how these fields are related to each other. But it is even more important for young people to acquire those skills and abilities that will enable them to take the responsibilities for expanding their own learning. Which of the following statements is NOT mentioned in the passage?"
"Do you know electricity can change the way we taste food?Proving this fact is a revolutionary electric fork designed by Japanese researchers that can make any dish taste salty. According to Hiromi Nakamura,a Post Doc Research Fellow at Tokyo's Meiji University,the technology can be very useful for people on special diets.Patients with high blood pressure,for instance,can easily go on a low-salt diet and still enjoy delicious food.And with the fork,there's  ly no risk of over-salting their food.Luckily,the voltage  is so small that there is no risk of electrocution  either. The idea of adding electricity to food was first exposed as an experiment at the Computer Human Interaction Conference in Austin,Texas,in 2012.Nakamura and her team connected a wire to a 9-volt battery and passed it through a straw placed in a cup of sweet lemonade.Volunteers reported that the charged lemonade tasted'blander',because the electricity created the taste of salt. Nakamura has improved the technology to be able to transfer an electric charge to food through forks and chopsticks.""The metallic part of the fork is one electrode ,and the handle is the other,""Nakamura explained.""When you take a piece of food with the fork and put it in your mouth,you connect the circuit.When you remove the fork from your mouth,you disconnect the circuit.So it actually works as a switch."" Simon Klose,host of food program Munchies,who recently visited Nakamura to try out the fork himself,called this form of'food hacking'one of the greatest eating experiences he'd ever had. ""When I first heard of electric food,it sounded scary,""he said.He later continued to use a charged fork to eat pieces of fried chicken,and found that the saltiness considerably increased as the electricity was connected. Nakamura has been eating'electric'food for the past three to four years in an attempt to understand it better.""For me,'food hacking'is about strengthening or weakening real food,""she said.""It may seem like we're cooking but we're actually working on the human senses."" From the passage,we learn that the electric fork  ."
"Grandpa Nybakken loved life -- especially when he could play a trick on somebody. At those times, his large Norwegian frame shook with laughter while he pretended innocent surprise, exclaiming, ""Oh, forevermore!"" But on a cold Saturday in downtown Chicago, Grandpa felt that God played a trick on him, and grandpa wasn't laughing. Grandpa worked as a carpenter. On this particular day, he was building some boxes for the clothes his church was sending to an orphanage abroad. On his way home, he reached into his shirt pocket to find his glasses, but they were gone. He remembered putting them there that morning, so he drove back to the church. His search proved fruitless. Suddenly, he realized what had happened. The glasses had slipped out of his pocket unnoticed and fallen into one of the boxes, which he had nailed shut. His brand new glasses were heading for China! The Great Depression was at its height, and Grandpa had six children. He had spent twenty dollars for those glasses that very morning. ""It's not fair,"" he told God as he drove home in frustration. ""I've been very faithful in giving of my time and money to your work, and now this."" Several months later, the director of the orphanage was on vacation in the United States.He wanted to visit all the churches that supported him, so he came to speak on Sunday night at my grandfather's small church in Chicago. Grandpa and his family sat in their usual seats among the small congregation  . ""But most of all,"" he said, ""I must thank you for the glasses you sent last year."" ""Even if I had the money, there was simply no way of replacing those glasses.Along with not being able to see well, I experienced headaches every day, so my co-workers and I were much in prayer about this. Then your boxes arrived.When my staff removed the covers, they found a pair of glasses lying on the top."" After a long pause, he continued, ""Folks, when I tried on the glasses, it was as though they had been custom-made just for me! I want to thank you for being a part of that!"" The people listened, happy for the amazing glasses. But the director surely must have confused their church with another, they thought, there were no glasses on their list of items to be sent overseas. But sitting quietly in the back, with tears streaming down his face, an ordinary carpenter realized _ had used him in an extraordinary way. The people in the church but Grandpa felt confused at what the director said because   _  ."

"In ancient times, there was a painter. He was good at painting flowers and birds. But he never stopped practicing until he became very famous. An emperor of China also loved paintings,especially roosters . So he asked the famous painter to paint a rooster for him. He wanted the rooster to be the best among all his collections. The painter promised to do so. The emperor waited and waited for one year.,but he didn't get the picture. He couldn't waited to see the painter. He became angry and wanted to kill him. So the painter hurried into the palace with paper,paint and a brush. In five minutes, a perfect rooster was on the paper. After seeing this,the emperor became much angrier. ""Since you can paint a rooster in five minutes, why did you keep me waiting for over a year?""he asked. ""Your Majesty ,""said the artist. ""I will let you know why.But you'll have to come with me. "" he invited the emperor to his house. There, there were piles and piles of paper. On every piece of paper was a painting of a rooster. ""Your Majesty ,""said the painter. ""It took me more than one year to improve my painting skill in order to paint a perfect rooster for you. From the passage we can learn that  _  ."

"A British company has proposed releasing genetically modified(GM)   diamondback moths, which would reduce the population of the vegetable-eating insects. Males carrying a deadly gene would be released, which would cause their young ones to die immediately. Then the fall in their numbers could help increase production for farmers. Oxitec, the company which came up with the idea, hopes to begin trials  next year, but some groups are saying no to them,, saying the untested technology could threaten wildlife and human health. ""Mass releases of GM insects into the British countryside would be impossible to recall if anything went wrong. Changing one part of an ecosystem  can have knock-on-effects on others in ways that are poorly understood. This could include an increase in different types of pests. Wildlife that feeds on insects could be impaired if there are changes to their food supply,"" said Dr Helen Wallace, the director of Gene-Watch UK. Hadyn Parry, Oxitec's chief executive, said that there was demand from farmers for the technology and that using GM insects to kill the pests that feed on food crops is better for the environment than chemical sprays. The firm is developing a number of GM insects that would be used in Britain and around the world to protect crops and fight disease in humans. Oxitec has contacted the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to ask what controls should be put in place around GM moth trials. A spokesman said that while its officials and advisers have discussed Oxitec's plans, there has not been a formal application for a trial. As a result, the department has not reached a view on whether it should go ahead. What is the purpose of releasing GM insects into the British countryside?"
"The world shares him and London claims him, but Stratford-on-Avon intends to spend 2016 celebrating Shakespeare as their man: the bard of Avon, who was born there in 1564, and died there 400 years ago. Stratford remained hugely important throughout Shakespeare's life, argues Paul Edmondson, the head of learning and research at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. ""People have seen Shakespeare as a Dick Whittington figure, who turns his back on Stratford and his family, goes to London to earn his fortune and only comes back to die,"" he said. ""But Stratford is where he bought land and property, where he kept his library, where he lived and read and thought. We are going to spend the year re-emphasizing the importance of Shakespeare, the man of Stratford."" The anniversary of the death of the most famous and the most performed playwright in the world will be marked across Britain and the globe. Macbeth is about to open in Singapore, Romeo and Juliet in Brussels. Shakespeare's Globe is completing the first world tour, in which it has taken Hamlet to almost every country. North Korea is still holding out, though. The Globe director recently jokily claimed Shakespeare as a true Londoner. Stratford, however, will be insisting that the town made and educated Shakespeare. ""His old school room in Stratford-on-Avon where Shakespeare learned 'small Latin and less Greek' --as kindly laughed at by his friend Ben Johnson--will open its doors, scarred by centuries of naughty schoolboys, to mark 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death,"" said Paul Edmondson. Shakespeare bought the splendid New Place, the second best house in the town, when he had made his fortune on the London stage. ""You don't buy a house like New Place and not live there,"" Paul said. He believes that after Shakespeare bought it, all his thinking time was spent there, and that the late plays, including The Tempest, were at least planned in his library and probably written there.

"If you want to keep healthy, you should have good habits. What is a habit? It is something we do very often. We don't even think when we do it. It has become a part of our lives. ""Early to bed, early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise."" This is an old English saying. Do you know what it means? It means that we must go to bed early at night and get up early in the morning. If we do, we shall be healthy, rich and clever. Is this true? Perhaps it is. We know the body must have enough sleep. Boys and girls need eight or nine hours' sleep every day. Some people go to bed late at night and get up late in the morning. This is a very bad habit. Then you will not think or do your work well. Of course, you can't be healthy, wealthy or wise. When we get up early in the morning, we can go out and do morning exercises. Exercise means doing things with the body. Walking, running jumping, swimming, and playing ball games are all exercise. If we don't exercise, our body will become weak. Exercise helps the blood   to move around inside our body. Blood takes food to all parts of our body. Our body also needs air to breathe. Without air, we will die. We must have lots of clean fresh air if we want to be healthy. That is why many people like to go out to do morning exercise. Which sport is NOT mentioned in the passage?"

"If you knew a bottle of water had been recycled from urine  , would you drink it? Astronauts at the International Space Station (ISS) may soon do so.  NASA   said it would use a high-tech machine   to recycle wastewater at the ISS. The machine will recycle everything from sweat  , the water for washing hands, shower water, water used for brushing teeth, and even urine, to make drinking water. It will save NASA millions of dollars each year. At present, each ISS astronaut uses about 4.4 liters   of water every day. It costs about $24 million a year to transport water up to ISS. NASA says that a liter of water costs about $11,000. The machine will be sent to the ISS in October 2008. NASA hopes it will recycle about 93% of all water used on the station.  Will the water be clean? Scientists say the wastewater will go through a very complicated process  . For example, different chemicals will be put in the wastewater; the water will be heated to 130degCto get rid of bacteria  . The recycled water is thousands of times better than the water from a city tap, scientists say. The reading mainly tells us something about   _  ."
"A few years ago it was popular to speak of a generation gap, a disagreement between young people and their elders.Parents said that children did not show them proper respect and obedience , while children complained that their parents did not understand them at all.What had gone wrong? Why had the generation gap suddenly appeared? Actually the generation gap has been _ for a long time.Many people argue that a gap is built into the fabric of our society. One important cause of the generation gap is the chance that young people have to choose their own ways of life.In more traditional societies, when children grow up, they are expected to live in the same area as their parents, to marry people that their parents know and agree to, and to continue the family occupation .In our society, young people often travel great distances for their education, move out of the family home at an early age, marry or live with people whom their parents have never met, and choose occupations different from those of their parents. In our easily changing society, parents often expect their children to do better than they did: to find better jobs, to make more money, and to do all the things that they were unable to do.Often, however, the strong desire that parents have for their children are another cause of the disagreement between them.Often, they discover that they have very little in common with each other. Finally, the speed at which changes take place in our society is another cause of the gap between the generations.In a traditional culture, elderly people are valued for their wisdom, but in our society the knowledge of a lifetime may become out of date overnight.The young and the old seem to live in two very different worlds, separated by different skills and abilities. No doubt, the generation gap will continue to be a feature of American life for some time to come.Its causes are rooted in the freedom and changes of our society, and in the rapid speed at which society changes.

"The teacher was leaving the village, and everybody seemed sorry.  The miller at Cresscombe lent him the small cart and horse to carry his goods to Christminster, the city of his destination, such a vehicle proving of quite enough size for the teacher's belongings.  For his only article, in addition to the packing-case of books, was a piano that he had bought when he thought of learning instrumental music.  But the eagerness having faded, he had never acquired any skill in playing, and the purchased article had been a permanent trouble to him. The headmaster had gone away for the day, being a man who disliked the sight of changes.  He did not mean to return till the evening, when the new teacher would have arrived, and everything would be smooth again. The blacksmith, the farm bailiff and the teacher were standing in confused attitudes in the sitting room before the instrument.  The teacher had remarked that even if he got it into the cart he should not know what to do with it on his arrival at Christminster, since he was only going into a temporary place just at first. A little boy of eleven, who had been assisting in the packing, joined the group of men, and said, ""Aunt has got a fuel-house, and it could be put there, perhaps, till you've found a place to settle in, sir."" ""Good idea,"" said the blacksmith. The smith and the bailiff started to see about the possibility of the suggested shelter, and the boy and the teacher were left standing alone. ""Sorry I am going, Jude."" said the latter gently. Tears rose into the boy's eyes.  He admitted that he was sorry. ""So am I,"" said Mr. Phillotson. ""Why do you go, sir?"" asked the boy. ""Well ----- don't speak of this everywhere.  You know what a university is, and a university degree?  It is the necessary hallmark of a man who wants to do anything in teaching.  My scheme, or dream, is to be a university graduate.  By going to live at Christminster, I shall be at headquarters, so to speak, and if my scheme is practicable at all, I consider that being on the spot will afford me a better chance."" The smith and _ returned.  Old Miss Fawley's fuel-house was practicable; and she seemed willing to give the instrument standing-room there.  So it was left in the school till the evening, when more hands would be available for removing it; and the teacher gave a final glance round. At nine o'clock Mr. Phillotson mounted beside his box of books, and waved his friends good-bye. It can be inferred that the teacher   _  ."
"Dear Jenny, I am in Beijing, China now, but my parents are in the USA. I live with my brother Peter. Beijing is big and great. There are many beautiful places and much delicious food here. I like Beijing very much. Peter and I are in the same grade, but we are in different classes. We live far from the school and it takes us a long time to go to school. We have to get up at 6:20 in the morning, and then at 6:30 we ride bikes to the bus stop. It takes us about 20 minutes. At about 7:00, we take the bus to school. We get to school at about 7:30. We have four classes in the morning and two in the afternoon. I think Chinese is too difficult, but Peter thinks it is easy. He can speak Chinese very well and he often helps me with it. How is everything going with you in the USA? Write to me soon. Love, Kate ,. Which of the followings is TRUE?"

"A farmer who lived in a small village had a bad pain in the chest. This never seemed to get any better. The farmer decided that he would go to see a doctor in the nearest town. But as he was a miserly  person, he thought he would find out how much he would have to pay the doctor. He was told that a sick person had to pay three pounds for the first visit and one pound for the second visit. The farmer thought about this for a long time, and then he decided to go to the doctor in the town. As he came into the doctor's room, he said, ""Good morning, doctor. Here I am again."" The doctor was a little surprised. He asked him a few questions, checked his chest and then took the pound which the farmer insisted on giving him. Then the doctor said with a smile, ""Well, sir, there's nothing new. Please go on taking the same medicine I gave you the first time you came to see me."" What did the farmer give the doctor?"

"Many people travel to different places in the world by air. Usually it takes a long time, perhaps half a day, for passengers to stay in the plan. So airlines offer passengers food. But it is common that they feel bad about food taste. Do you agree? To solve this problem, airlines try hard to improve their food. They would like to do so because they don't want to lose customers. However, according to scientific research, part of the reason why plane food tastes bad is that at high altitude we can not taste things as well as we do on the ground. Also scientists have found that our noses become very dry even before a plane takes off. As the plane moves up, the change in air  pressure reduces one third of the sensibility of our taste buds . So our taste buds become senseless. The sad face, however, is that our noses don't know it. All of these help explain why food on the plane tastes so bad. They also help explain why airlines choose to offer passengers salty and spicy food. Without doing so, the food would be tasteless. Now there are many researches on this. According to one of them, some volunteers are asked to lie with their feet higher than their heads for weeks. And scientists write down their feelings about food taste. Though scientists try their best, it is not as easy as they thought. Because they can't deal with the special environment successfully, such as the change in air pressure, making food taste good is still hard for them. As the plane moves up, the change in air pressure reduces  _  of the sensibility of our taste buds."

"There was once a rich old _ ) in England who lived a very rich life. When King John, who was the worst king that England ever had, heard of the way in which the abbot lived, he decided to stop it. So he sent for the old man and said, ""Your fault is clear, and unless you can answer me three questions within two weeks, your head shall be cut off, and all your money shall be mine. Firstly, you must tell me just how long I shall live. Secondly, you must tell me how long I shall ride round the whole world, and lastly, you shall tell me what I think.""       The abbot went to Oxford and Cambridge for help but not one of the teachers in the great schools could. At last, sad and sorrowful, he rode towards home. Then he met his shepherd   and told him all that had happened.        ""Cheer up, good master. I think I can help you out of your trouble.""        The shepherd dressed himself up with great care and looked just like the abbot. Then he went to the king.        ""How long shall I live?"" ""You will live until the day that you die, and not one day longer.""        ""How long shall I ride round the world?"" ""You must rise with the sun, and you must ride with the sun until it rises again the next morning. As soon as you do that, you will find that you have ridden round the world in twenty-four hours.""        ""What do I think?"" ""You think that I am the abbot. But, to tell you the truth, I am only his poor shepherd, and I come to beg your pardon for him and for me.""         The king laughed long. ""Very well then, you have won the old abbot a free pardon from King John for this joke."" The purpose of the passage is to   _  ."
"You get all sorts of demands, and the mark of a good hotel is to supply whatever is asked for without sounding surprised. If a guest asks for rubbers gloves, you don't ask why. You say, ""No problem. What color1 do you want?""   There have been some demands which, much as I would have liked to fill, I couldn't. A Japanese businessman, for example, thought the manager of a hotel was like his girlfriend so he asked me to marry him to the woman he loved. There was one time, however,  _ . A young man thought that if he asked his girlfriend to marry him at the Ritz she would say yes. He asked us to put the ring in a cake, and she accepted.    Top hotels are used more and more to impress. They are used for doing business. If you've got something to sell, take your clients  to the best hotel where the surroundings are quite helpful. A friend of mine working at Savoy Hotel tells the story about a man who gave him 5 pounds to say ""Good morning, Mr. Smith saying, ""I do wish they would leave me alone at this place.""   According to Julian Payne, the most powerful people in any hotel are the porters, who carry bags for hotel guests. ""Porters can do almost anything. They can get you tables at the best restaurants or tickets for a popular concert. Don't ask me how they do it or what their deal is because I don't know. Most of them have been there for years. They know more about the history of the hotel and the guests than anyone else. They are invaluable. A head porter will come in even on his day off so he can say hello to someone he remembers visiting the hotel years ago."" Which of the following examples explains ""we did help out?"""
"A good modern newspaper is an extraordinary piece of reading. It is remarkable first for what it contains: the range of news from local crime to international politics, from sport to business to fashion to science, and the range of comment and special features as well, from editorial page to feature articles and interviews to criticism of books, art, theatre and music. A newspaper is even more remarkable for the way one reads it: never completely, never straight through, but always by jumping from here to there, in and out glancing at one piece, reading another article all the way through, reading just a few paragraghs of the next. A good modern newspaper offers a variety to attract many different readers, but far from one reader is interested in what brings this variety together in. One place is its topicality , its immediate relation to what is happening in your world and your locality now. But immediacy and the speed of production that goes with it mean also that much of what appears in a newspaper has no more than transient  value. For all these reasons, no two people really read the same paper: what each person does is to put together out of the pages of that day's paper, his own selection and sequence, his own newspaper. For all these reasons, reading newspapers efficiently, which means getting what you want from them without missing things you need but without wasting time, demands skill and self-awareness as you modify and apply the techniques of reading.

"Two men in Shanghai have been dead from H7N9, while a woman in Anhui province is seriously ill from the virus, the National Health and Family Planning Commission  said on Sunday. This is the first time a human from H7N9 has been found. Little research has been done on this unknown bird flu, and three are no vaccines  against the virus. The reported deaths were of an 87-year-old man who was found ill on Feb. 19 and died on March 4, and a 27-year-old man who was found ill on Feb. 27 and died on March 10. The third person, a 35-year-old woman from Chuzhou, Anhui province, is in hospital in Nanjing, Jiangsu province. It is still unknown how the three became ill, and experts said there is no evidence  that they caught the illness from each other. There is also no evidence of anyone who stay closely with them being ill. To be away from H7N9 and stay healthy, remember the following things. * Go to crowded places as less as possible, especially the elderly and children.

"Long live language. That's the message Edmonton Mayor Don Iveson and city councilor Amarjeet Sohi voiced when they declared Feb. 21 to be International Mother Language Day (IMLD) in Edmonton, the capital of the Canadian province of Alberta. The pair were on hand for the International and Heriage Languages Association's (IHLA) 12th annual Mother Language Day celebrations in an effort to save endangered languages. ""Keeping languages alive is important for me richness of our culture and the diversity that strengthens Edmonton,"" said Iveson. There are nearly 7,000 unique languages spoken worldwide, but according to data from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) half of those languages are at risk of going extinct in just a few generations. For example, there are currently over 3,000 languages spoken throughout Africa. This sounds impressive until you realize that there were over 10,000 languages spoken on the continent before colonization during the 19th century. ""People who lose their language experience suffering,"" said Olenka Bilash, professor of second language education at the University of Alberta. Bilash likened the loss of language to the loss of cultural identity. ""As a multicultural society, it is very important to continue to preserve and pass on to future generations the language, culture, traditions and customs that we bring to Canada, "" said IHLA president Olga Prokhorova. While the City of Edmonton's citizen and new arrival centre in city hall provides services in 150 languages, Bilash said research shows that ""most people are still uncomfortable speaking their own language in public spaces."" Bliash hopes the official announcement of International Mother Language Day in Edmonton----which _ International Mother Language Day declared by UNESCO in 1999 ---- will be a step toward encouraging more language diversity in order to preserve the cultures tied to them. ""Our words define us; our expressions and vocabulary define who we are as people,"" said Marueen Kubinec, Alberta's minister of culture and tourism. ""Our words are living examples, perhaps the best that there are, of human creativity."" What can we learn from Kubinec's words ?"
"The most common use of intelligence test scores is to predict degree of academic success. Such scores are used in some communities as bases for admitting able children to schools at ages younger than normal, and they are very generally used to determine admissions to schools beyond public secondary school. Another use common in elementary schools involves comparing such scores with performances in various subjects to identify children who are working below capacity. The greatest problem in using intelligence tests for the purpose of prediction is that no dependable criterion of their accuracy exists. The ideal criteria would be objective and reliable achievement tests following instruction in each subject, but there are few such tests, especially at the college level. Studies have shown that correlations  between intelligence tests and achievement tests in various subjects through secondary school range roughly from 0.5 to 0.8. Such correlations are fairly high, but they do not suggest anywhere near complete agreement. At the college level there are two major tests used as criteria of admission. By far the more important is the College Entrance Examination, constructed by the Educational Testing Service authorized by the College Entrance Examination Board. These tests are returned to the Educational Testing Service for scoring, and the results are then made available to the various colleges authorized by the students to receive them. The second test of this type is the American College Test, which operates in essentially the same fashion. Both tests constitute measures of certain skills, abilities, and knowledge that have been found to be related to success in college. Their correlations with academic success are limited for three outstanding reasons. First, measures of achievement in college are themselves perhaps no more reliable than those in elementary and secondary schools. Second, intellectual factors do not alone determine academic success, especially at the college level. Many students drop out of schools because they are inadequately motivated or because they dislike the instructional programme. Third, correlations are lowered because the use of such tests for denying admission to some students means that the range of scores for those admitted is restricted, and such restriction tend to reduce correlation. The correlations between two college admission tests and academic success in college are limited for the reason that   _  ."

"Why do plants grow in some places and not in others? Why does some land have so much growing on it, while other land has almost no plants growing on it at all? To grow, plants need several things. One is warmth. In very cold places almost nothing grows. Plants also need water. In very dry parts of the Earth only a few unusual plants can grow. That's why dry deserts everywhere are almost not covered by trees or grass.  Plants must also have a place in which to put down their roots and grow. They find it difficult to grow on hard land. The town is built on hard land. The plants here have only the soil found between the _ cracks of the stones to grow in. Another thing plants must have before they can grow is food.  What will happen if we try to make things grow on the sandy beach? A few plants, such as beach grass, will grow in sand, but most plants won't. Even if the weather is warm enough and we water the plants each day, many of them will die because the sand on this beach has almost no food for plants. According to the passage, plants need_things to grow well."
"Over the next 20 to 50 years, it will become harder to tell the difference between the human and the machine. All body parts will be replaceable. A computer will function like the human brain with the ability to recognize feelings and respond with emotions. They can then make fake people. We will then be able to create a machine duplicate   of ourselves so we will appear to be alive long after we are dead. Maybe a few decades later, a way will be found to transfer our spirit to the new body. Then we can choose to live for as long as we want. Once one of you is duplicated, you will just have to press Ctrl + D and you will have two of you. If you want 500, select 500. Naturally, when duplicates are running around all over the place, there will be a food problem. The most practical choice would be garbage. Your modified duplicate will be made to eat garbage like a goat. But don't worry. Their taste buds and sense of smell will be changed so they will really enjoy it. They will want to eat lots of garbage. When it becomes possible to do a spirit transfer, you will be able to live within whichever duplicate you want, whenever you want and as long as you want. Just imagine what it would be like when you are with so many duplicates of yourself. You will be very busy enjoying many things. One duplicate of yourself is in the middle of doing a jigsaw puzzle   and another duplicate has almost completed another puzzle. When you become tired of the joy of puzzles, ""you"" jump to the duplicate that is eating garbage, then to the one that is playing in a rock concert, then to the one that is scoring the winning goal. You will be so busy enjoying so many things that it could drive you crazy.  When it is predicted that things will be better in the future, it doesn't necessarily mean that things will be easier!

"Like many new graduates, I left university full of hope for the future but with no real idea of what I wanted to do. My degree, with honors, in English literature had not really prepared me for anything practical. I knew I wanted to make a difference in the world somehow, but I had no idea how to do that. That's when I learned about the Lighthouse Project. I started my journey as a Lighthouse Project volunteer by reading as much as I could about the experiences of previous volunteers. I knew it would be a lot of hard work, and that I would be away from my family and friends for a very long time. In short, I did not take my decision to apply for the Lighthouse Project lightly. Neither did my family. Eventually, however, I won the support of my family, and I sent in all the paperwork needed for the application. After countless interviews and presentations, I managed to stand out among the candidates and survive the test alone. Several months later, I finally received a call asking me to report for the duty. I would be going to a small village near Abuja, Nigeria. Where? What? Nigeria? I had no idea. But I was about to find out. After completing my training, I was sent to the village that was small and desperately in need of proper accommodation. Though the local villagers were poor, they offered their homes, hearts, and food as if I were their own family. I was asked to lead a small team of local people in building a new schoolhouse. For the next year or so, I taught in that same schoolhouse. But I sometimes think I learned more from my students than they did from me. Sometime during that period, I realized that all those things that had seemed so strange or unusual to me no longer did, though I did not get anywhere with the local language, and returned to the United States a different man. The Lighthouse Project had changed my life forever. In his application for the volunteer job, the author  _"
"As an English teacher, one of the most common problems I've found with my students is their lack of confidence with speaking, and difficulty in understanding native speakers. Another problem could be that a foreign language taught in schools can sound quite different to what native speakers actually use. There are a few English words and expressions that I'd never heard until I came to China. The most common one in my experience is ""How are you? I'm fine, thank you, and you?"" I appreciate that although this greeting is much too formal for everyday use - it's easy to learn and helps build confidence. However, it can be a hard habit to break. I've seen many parents correct their kids if they don't use that exact phrase, as if simply replying ""I'm fine"" would somehow be rude. In fact I'm banning my students from saying that in the classroom, insisting a simple ""I'm fine, thanks"" is good enough. ""Seldom"" is another one that I find interesting. The first time a student told me ""I seldom watch TV"", my initial reaction was a stupefied look, followed by ""Huh?"" I then realized the student used ""seldom"" when it's more common for us to use ""rarely."" I was just as confused when I first heard a toilet referred to as a WC (water closet), another English term I'd never heard of back in Australia. Of course, my students know the other names for it like bathroom, toilet, washroom etc. so to prefer that name is an interesting choice.   I don't mind that my students have substituted familiar English words with their own, far from it. It reminds me how creative they can be with not only their language, but with mine as well. It's healthy for English to evolve   and change and I'm happy to add these new words to my vocabulary. One important lesson I've learnt is that textbooks can only help you so much. For further improvement you'd better practice with native speakers. The problem with the reply ""I'm fine, thank you, and you?"" is that it is   _  ."
"I do not need a calendar to tell me when it is winter. All I need is my nose. When I wake up in the morning and smell the tasty treats my mom is cooking downstairs, I know winter has arrived. The first one is the smell of chocolate. During the holiday season (from Thanksgiving to New Year's Day) my mother makes her special hot chocolate. She always adds a peppermint candy cane   to the drink and tops it with cream. The hot chocolate gets me out of bed, but it is my mother's chocolate fudge   that makes me run downstairs. It is a thick chunk   of chocolate that tastes like heaven. My mother adds nuts. That gives it more texture  . But my mother isn't done yet. She also makes a treat she calls ""window panes  "". She takes a few different colored marshmallows   and melts them together with chocolate. The final product looks like a colorful church window, so we call it ""window panes"".

"If you are like most people ,your intelligence   changes with the seasons ,You are probably a lot sharper in the spring than you are at any other time of year . A famous scientist ,Ellsworth Huntington (1876--1947),concluded   from other men's work and his own among people in different climates that climate and temperature have an effect   on your mental abilities  . He found that cool weather is much more favorable for creative   thinking than summer heat .This does not mean that all people are less intelligent in the summer than they are during the rest of the year. It does mean, however , that the mental abilities of large numbers of people tend to be lowest in the summer . Spring appears to be the best period of the year for thinking One reason may be that in the spring man's mental abilities are affected by the same factors   that bring about great changes in nature .

One day after school I rode my bike to the Agins, which, I learned years later, was known for its high-end fashions and style.I introduced myself to Sylvia Agins, telling her I was looking for a Mather's Day present. ""Do you think she'd like a purse?"" she askeD.I told her.I thought she might. She took out an Italian handbag made of leather. She asked me what I thought, and I told her that my mom would like it.

She gift-wrapped  the purse and thanked me for my business, and I rode off home with the package under my arm. When my mother opened the gift the next Sunday morning, she asked in an accusing tone, ""Where did you get this?"" ""I bought it at the Agins. It cost me $11."" I said. My mother was shocked into silence. It wasn't until many years later, when I learned that the purse was worth several hundred dollars, that I appreciated just how wonderful Sylvia Agins had been to me.

"Can you remember any of the bad habits you used to have when you were very young? Perhaps, as a baby, you used to suck your thumb . Of course, you do not do that any more, but you can surely remember your mother's efforts to train you.

We can't give them up easily, either.(Anyone who has tried to give up smoking knows this very well!) Each period brings its own problems. In babyhood, it's thumb-sucking; in childhood, it's nail-biting; in our teens, it's smoking; in middle-age, it's over-eating, and so on.

"The American local food movement has been all about buying seasonal food from nearby farmers. Now, thanks to the Web, it is expanding to include far-away farmers too. A new start-up, Foodzie, is an online farmers market where small food producers and growers can sell their products. Foodzie was started by Mr LaFave and two of his friends, who met during college at Virginia Tech, where they would pay frequent visits to farmers markets. Last year, while living in North Carolina, one of them, Emily Olson, now 24, came up with one idea. She was working as a brand manager for a _ grocery chain and realized that people who enjoyed fine food but didn't work in the business had no way to discover handmade foods outside their local farmers markets. Small farmers had no way of finding or selling to faraway customers, either. Mr LaFAve and the third co-founder, Nik Bauman, both 25, worked in corporate sales and software development. ""With business, food and computer science backgrounds, we figured we had everything we needed."" Mr LaFAve said. The three quit their jobs, and opened this site to the public in December and the site has had 43,000 visitors in the past month. So far, 29 sellers have opened shops and 41 are in the process of opening them. The founders recently hired a fourth employee to help Ms Olson recruit  new food producers at farmers markets and food shows. Mr LaFAve is convinced that the recession  will not reduce people's interest in buying locally grown and handmade food. ""There is misunderstanding that all these foods are more expensive than mass-produced alternatives,"" he said. ""People are pouring their heart and soul into these products, and they are of the highest quality."" About the three founders, we know that   _  ."
"When people have money, they have the freedom to choose how to use it. Some people have more money than others, but no one has all the money in the world. The amount of money we have is limited. The supply of goods, land, and resources is limited. Because of this, people can not have or buy everything that they might want. This means that if you have only five dollars to spend, you can not buy something that costs ten dollars. As our country has grown in the number of citizens, the price of goods has increased. In the recent years the cost of food, clothing, housing and cars has risen quickly. The price of films and books has gone up. In a time when prices are rising, people cannot buy as much with the money as before. People  _   even if they are millionaires."
"More People Are Leaving the Rat Race for the Simple Life Time is more precious than money for an increasing number of people who are choosing to live more with less--and liking it Kay and Charles Giddens, two lawyers, sold their home to start a B&B hotel.Four years later, the couple dishes out banana pancake breakfast, cleans toilets and serves homemade chocolate chip cookies to guests in a B&B hotel surrounded by trees on a hill known for colorful sunsets. ""Do I miss the freeways? Do I miss the traffic? Do I miss the stress? No,"" says Ms.Giddens, ""This is a phenomenon that's fairly widespread. A lot of people are reevaluating their lives and figuring out what they want to do.If their base is being damaged, what's the payoff?"" Simple living ranges from cutting down on weeknight activities to sharing housing, living closer to work, avoiding shopping malls, borrowing books from the library instead of buying them, and taking a cut in pay to work at a more pleasurable job. Vicki Robin, a writer, lives on a budget equal to a fifth of what she used to make.""You become conscious about where your money is going and how valuable it is,"" Ms.Robin says, ""You tend not to use things up.You cook at home rather than eat out..."" Janet Luhrs, a lawyer, quit her job after giving birth and leaving her daughter with a nanny for two weeks.""It was not the way I wanted to raise my kids,"" she says, ""Simplicity is not just about saving money; it's about me sitting down every night with my kids to a candlelit dinner with classical music."" Mrs.Luhrs now edits a magazine,Simple Living, which publishes tips on how to buy recycled furniture and shoes, organize potluck dinners instead of expensive receptions, and generally how to consume less. ""It's not about poverty,"" Mrs.Luhrs explains, ""It's about conscious living and creating the life you want.The less stuff you buy, the less money goes out of the door, and the less money you have to earn.""

"""Did you go skating a lot last year?"" I asked. Jen shook her head and looked at me. Finally she said, ""On Thanksgiving, Mom and I always went to visit some friends who lived on a farm. I especially loved seeing their big turkeys."" Until then, I didn't think about how Jen felt. She had a new stepfather   and stepbrother, and had a new town and home, too. Jen and her mom used to live near a lake where Dad and I went every summer, and she had to move up north with us. She had more changes than me. Jen seemed sad, so I was busy thinking of some ways to cheer her up on Thanksgiving. I told her my plan and she was excited. First we made a huge snowball, and then a small snowball. Then we built a wall behind the big snowball as a tail. Jen mixed some food coloring with water, saying, ""We can spray   colors on the tail."" Our snow turkey had a red, blue, green, and yellow tail. We were so busy that we didn't notice our parents come outside. Dad found a hat for the snow turkey, and Mom wrapped her scarf around its neck. "" _ ,"" Mom said. ""You're a good brother, and you always come up with great ideas.'' A happy feeling spread through me. I began to understand how much she cared about everyone in our new family. What did Jen do on Thanksgiving in the past?"
"Ms. Strawberry loved to make vanilla cupcakes! Everyone loved her cupcakes, and she loved making them, too. One morning, she was in the store, buying ingredients for her  cupcakes, when she came across the most delicious looking chocolate frosting she had ever seen in her life! She bought a whole bunch, excited about how delicious her cupcakes would be for her cupcake party tonight! She went home and took extra care making her cupcakes that afternoon. She made them extra fluffy, sweet and delicious. She even pulled out her favorite sprinkles for her cupcakes, bright purple ones, which was her favorite color. She couldn't believe how amazing her cupcakes were going to be for the cupcake party! That night at the cupcake party, Ms. Strawberry showed everyone her plate of delicious cupcakes! So many of her friends were there for the party. There was Mrs. Apple, Mr. Banana, Ms. Mitten, Mr. Green and even quiet Mr. Lemon showed up. Everyone was very happy about her cupcakes! Everyone except Mr. Lemon. Mr. Lemon took one bite of that cupcake and said, ""Eew! This is the worst cupcake in the world!"" Ms. Strawberry didn't know what to say! Were they really the worst cupcakes in the world? She had tried so hard! Ms. Strawberry started to cry. ""Why don't you like my cupcakes, Mr. Lemon? I worked so hard to make the extra delicious!"" Mr. Lemon said, ""I don't like vanilla, and I don't like chocolate!"" Ms. Strawberry cried even more! ""There, there,"" said Mrs. Apple, and patted Ms. Strawberry on the head.  ""It's okay. Not everyone is going to like your cupcakes! You only have to know that you worked hard and that they're still tasty!"" With that, Ms. Strawberry stopped crying, and she and Mr. Lemon made up. Ms. Strawberry's cupcake party was that..."
"More and more people think it necessary to study in an English-speaking country and it didn't take long at all for me to decide to come and study in UK. Having been in the school for 2 months, I'm getting used to school life, and I am starting to make the most of my time in here. School starts at 9 o'clock every morning, and every Monday, Wednesday and Friday we have long days, in which we have 9 lessons and school finishes at 4 o'clock. Every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturdays we have short days, in which we have only 6 lessons and finish at 1 o'clock. After lessons, we have two hours of activity time, when you can choose from a wide range of activities, including all the major sports, such as rugby and football, and also the minor sports such as basketball and tennis. As a boarder( ),the quality of food is something I consider very important, and Merchiston has not _ . The school kitchens are run by a professional food company, and the quality of food is very excellent and also they take the healthy diet very seriously: I remember once I was once asked to take more salad for my meal by a member of the kitchen staff  for I didn't have enough vegetables. This brings another point of being a boarder: you need to learn how to look after yourself and be responsible  for yourself.

"Pets provide an unconditional love that requires very little on the part of the human. Animals are so special to those of us who love them. We miss them when they are no longer with us. We grieve   for them in ways which are just the same as grieving for a human loved one. Whether the end comes through old age, illness, or sudden death, the death of a pet can cause enormous feelings of sorrow, guilt, and loneliness for children and adults alike, as the animal was considered a family member, a child's favoured playmate, or an older person's loyal and faithful companion. Some people don't want a pet because they do die! It's understandable to be unwilling to expose yourself to death but, at the same time, _ . When we live with animals we're more in step with the rhythms of the planet from day to night and from season to season because our companions make us more aware of the changes around us. Our companion animals teach us about the simple gifts of a beautiful day, a good meal and a gentle touch. The death of a pet can make us struggle with our belief structure-a natural part of the grieving period. Whether grieving an animal or human, we question our beliefs and many people find their belief structure becomes stronger when they ask themselves hard questions. Others find a new way of acceptance. And we learn from our animals. Animals aren't afraid to die; they show us that the end of life can be faced without fear. They can teach us to accept death as an opening for love and wonder. Allow yourself to grieve in whatever way is appropriate for you. The loss of a pet is real grief and causes us to travel through the stages of grief-denial, anger, depression, guilt, and acceptance. These stages must be lived through for the mourning to allow full healing. According to the passage, we can infer that  _  ."
"After finishing my teaching for a school year, I thought that I should go back to Montreal, Quebec, my hometown for a visit. My main goal was to relax in preparation for the challenges of my retirement in the coming year. Through my stay in Montreal, I met lots of Chinese who are struggling to succeed and then lead a better life in Canada. Some travelled thousands of miles to get knowledge. When I spoke with some of them about the major barrier they had to face after they arrived in Canada, they all talked about the two official languages of Canada. But I was impressed by their ability to express their ideas while switching between English and French. Almost all of those people said they often felt homesick. They miss their families and friends. Though Montreal has lots of Chinese restaurants, they long for a home-cooked meal. I met some tourists who were trying to realize their childhood dreams of experiencing the life in a developed country. When I asked them if Montreal had lived up to their expectations, they hesitated. They said that reality never agrees with fantasies. However, they were glad to have the opportunity to visit Montreal and didn't regret taking the trip. Not all the Chinese people I met were happy. I once met a young lady who met with a gentleman through the Internet. However, to her disappointment, he disappeared after he promised to marry her in Montreal. I was served by another Chinese person who could not handle the challenges of studying in an English environment and ended up working in a restaurant with minimum pay. Exploring different parts of the world, without any doubt, is an enriching experience. However, one should be realistic when it comes to leaving his hometown to set up a new life in a foreign country. One should take the time to examine the advantages and the shortcomings of the venture before they decide to chase an uncertain dream of achieving success or leading a better life. The main barrier for some Chinese to get knowledge in Canada is   _  ."
"AC/DC have postponed their US tour after singer Brian Johnson was warned by doctors that he was at risk of ""total hearing loss"". This is unsurprising, given the decades that the Australian band has been pumping out the hard rock decibels . But deafness isn't only a concern for rock musicians. In recent years it has become clear that anyone around music a lot has reason to be equally worried. When exposed to music, risk to hearing arises from a combination of how loud the sound is and how long you're exposed to it. If you visit a nightclub that is thumping out  music on the dance floor at 100 dB, then after only 10-15 minutes the exposure is potentially damaging. In a quieter part of the club, but where the music is still loud enough that you have to shout at your friends, then you could be there for a couple of hours before having to worry about your hearing. Of course music frequently exceeds 80-85 dB, but what counts most in assessing the risk to hearing is the average exposure. Exposure to high noise levels often causes temporary deafness - something many people have experienced after going to a nightclub. While hearing usually recovers after a few hours or days, repeated loud exposure leads to permanent hearing damage. Initially, this damage is subtle and unlikely to be noticed by the listener. Problems only becomes significant in middle age when the noise-induced hearing loss combines with the natural loss of hearing due to ageing. Improved technology means that the number of musicians having to give up performing could decrease, but student musicians need to be educated about the dangers of noise-caused hearing loss. The increasing use of headphones will also work against this - for musicians and everyone else. Unless people are careful with the volume level on their portable music players, hearing loss caused by music will increase.

"Some people make art with paint, and others use pencil or clay. But Italian artist Maurizio Savini prefers to use bright pink gum--after it has been chewed. Savini makes huge sculptures of bears and even people out of used chewing gum. Each sculpture requires thousands of pieces of gum. ""I like to use chewing gum because it seemed to me a material that can be used in many ways compared with those used by the conventional arts such as painting,"" Savini says. How does he do it? The process is a lot like working with clay. ""I work the chewing gum when it is warm and shape it with a knife,"" says Savini. Then, he puts a chemical onto each gum sculpture to make the gum stay in place. Savini's sticky art has been shown in cities like London, Paris, and Rome, where he lives today. Savini isn't the only artist to work with gum. His pink sculptures have inspired artists all over the world to get creative with the sticky matter. London artist Ben Wilson paints small paintings onto flat pieces of chewed gum he finds stuck to streets and sidewalks. In Canada, Jason Kronenwald uses different colored gum to make portraits of famous people. Kronenwald seldom chews gum himself. Instead, his friends help chew gum for him while he's working. ""At times it can make me _ , but I just pay attention to the colors I need and get the sculpture going,"" he says. In America, Jamie Marraccini's art depends on color, so he tests different kinds of gum before using them. To find out what color the chewed gum will become once hardened, he lets it age for up to six months. ""I've created 30 works totaling more than 35,000 pieces of gum,"" says Marraccini. That's a lot of gum! So think twice the next time you throw away a wad of gum. Maybe what seems like trash could actually be the beginning of a great piece of art.

"The green turtle is listed as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Under the U.S. Endangered Species Act of 1973, the green turtle was listed as threatened except for the breeding populations in Florida and on the Pacific coast of Mexico, where it is listed as endangered. Green turtles continue to be caught for money by humans, and the destruction and loss of nesting and foraging sites is a serious problem. Humans have already caused the decrease of large green turtle populations, including those that once nested in Bermuda and Cayman Islands. The situation of green turtle populations is difficult to determine because of our lack of knowledge about their life cycles. The number of nests in Florida appears to be increasing, but we don't know whether this is due to an increase in the number of nests or because we have started to monitor nesting beaches more closely. The green turtle is the largest hardshelled sea turtle. Adults of this species commonly reach 100 cm in length and 150 kg in mass. The average size of a female nesting in Florida is 101.5 cm straight in length, with an average body mass of 136 kg. Growth rates of green turtles have not been measured under natural conditions. Green turtles grow slowly. In the southern Bahamas, green turtles grow from 30 to 75 cm in 17 years, and according to Bjorndal and Bolten, growth rates decrease with increasing length. Growth rates measured in green turtles from Florida and Puerto Rico fall within the range of growth rates measured in the southern Bahamas. Based on growth rate studies of wild green turtles, the researchers Balazs, Frazer and Ehrhart estimate the age of sexual maturity can range anywhere from 20 to 50 years. Which of the following is NOT a reason why green turtles are endangered?"

"Whether or not to go to university will probably be the biggest educational decision you ever make. After battling with student finance, deciding whether or not to take a year out can be as terrifying as deciding where to move to for the three years. Some students will have planned their year out for months, but, for others, slipped grades may force a gap year , either to retake exams or to apply to different universities. Others might just need time to think. Thankfully, for U.K. students, taking a gap year remains a good option and it can be one of the most productive and fulfilling years of their life. Whether you've planned and budgeted for a year abroad, or have made a last-minute decision to delay your first year, the options are endless. Traveling, volunteering and so on are all there for the talking. With so many things on offer, it's important to remember that 12 months won't be enough time to do all of them, so decide early and work towards making whatever you want to do a reality. Researching a gap year is exciting, and often the place to start is at home. Family and friends can be a great source of inspiration. Your school or college might be fully equipped to advise you on what to do when further education is _ . Don't underestimate the power of the Internet, either. Typing a ""gap year"" into a search engine might seem too obvious, but planning to travel around the world for months on your own is not appropriate. To stay at home or go abroad is likely to be the first question you consider, but in this era of budget flights, doing both is practicable. A European inter-rail ticket can be as little as PS 159. For those loving traveling, they must be on the special watchfulness for tricks in the process. Agencies can organize your year abroad for you, and often, it is more effective to make the bookings through the agencies. But flights and other forms of transport within Asia and America are much cheaper when bought in the countries rather than bought in advance.

"If you live in the United States, you can't have a full-time job until you are 16 years old. At 14 or 15, you work part-time after school or on weekends, and during summer vacation you can work 40 hours each week. Does all that mean that if you are younger than 14, you can't make your own money? Of course not! Kids from 10-13 years of age can make money by doing lots of things. Valerie, 11, told us that she made money by cleaning up other people's yards. Lena, 13, makes money by knitting  dog sweaters and selling them to her neighbors. Reisa said she had started taking art classes and showing her works to people. People ask her to draw pictures for them and they pay her for them. Jasmine, 13, writes articles for different magazines! Kids can learn lots of things from making money. By working to make your own money, you are learning the skills you will need in life. These skills can include things like how to get along with others, how to use technology and how to use your time wisely. Some people think that asking for money is a lot easier than making it; however, if you can make your own money, you don't have to depend on anyone else. The five dollars that you make will probably make you feel a lot better than the twenty dollars you ask for. If you are 15 years old, you can't work part-time  _  ."

Now his trial was about to begin, and he felt sure that he would be found guilty and sent to prison for a long time. Then he discovered that an old friend of his was one of the members of the jury at his trial. Of course, he did not tell anybody, but he managed to see his friend secretly one day. He said to him, ""Jim, I know that the jury will find me guilty of having stolen the money. I cannot hope to be found not guilty of taking it ---- that would be too much to expect.

The other eleven people on the jury look terribly strong-minded to me."" George said that he would quite understand if Jim was not able to do anything for him, and thanked him warmly for agreeing to help. The trial went on, and at last the time came for the jury to decide whether George was guilty or not. It took them five hours, but in the end they found George guilty, with a strong recommendation for mercy. Of course, George was very pleased, but he did not have a chance to see Jim for some time after the trial. At last, however, Jim visited him in prison, and George thanked him warmly and asked him how he had managed to persuade the other members of the jury to recommend mercy.

"Success starts within our mind. Now, we will discuss four steps to change our lives and create a new future.    # 1. Think big. Get rid of negative beliefs.      Your beliefs have developed from what happened to you in the past. You should realize that the past is not equal to the future, unless you really live there. The first thing you need to do is to drive all the negative beliefs away from your mind. Those beliefs are not useful for creating a new future. Think that everything is possible if you put enough effort in it. When you change your beliefs into positive ones, you will feel more powerful. You will then be able to move on to the next level.    # 2. Write your plan to achieve your goals.      Your great goals should be divided into smaller goals. Make a timetable for each goal so that you can measure your progress. Write a detailed plan to achieve these goals.    # 3.Take action according to your plan.      Nothing bears fruit without action. Every successful person has to work hard towards his or her goals. There is no exception . Be prepared to work according to your plan. Be willing to invest   in the resources necessary for your progress. Do not give up.    # 4. Review what you have done and know how good you are.      While you are in the process of your work, take some time to review how well you have done. Review your progress based on your plan and see if you need to change anything. You can change your methods but you should not change your goals. Which of the following has the same meaning as ""Nothing bears fruit without action.""?"
"I liked most of my teachers in college. They were, for the most part, friendly and competent, willing to help students. I liked them--but I don't remember them very well, except for Mr. Jones, my senior English teacher. He was an enthusiastic, sensitive man, who knew his subject and was determined that we would learn it and love it, too.  Mr. Jones was a tall, slim man in his midforties. Put precariously  on his nose, his glasses gave him a serious look. But they didn't remain there long, for he was always taking them off and polishing them and putting them in his mouth when he thought over a response to a student's question. When he walked into class, he was always carrying two or three books with strips of paper sticking out of them, marking passages he planned to read. I remember, too, the cardigan sweaters--he must have had a dozen of them. On rainy days he substituted a blue raincoat for the sweater. But what I remember best was his smile. When he smiled, his whole face lit up. His smile made you feel good, at ease.  Yet though he was friendly with people, he was a bit formal in class, and he could be firm on occasion. He never called us by our first names. He obviously loved his work and liked his students, but he kept his distance. He never deliberately embarrassed a student in front of the class with an ironic remark, but he could communicate his displeasure all right. He'd look steadily at the offending student for a few seconds. That was usually enough, but if it didn't work, he'd say something to the student in a lowered tone of voice. He didn't do this often, though.  Mr. Jones' personality and passion made him popular, but what I liked most about him was that he was a fine teacher. Yes, he cared about students, but he cared more about teaching them his subject. And that meant homework, lots of it, and pop quizzes now and then to keep them reading. He lectured occasionally to provide background information whenever we moved on to a new literary period. After a brief glance at his notes, he'd begin to move around as he talked--to the blackboard, to the window, back to the platform. But he preferred discussions. He'd write several questions on the board for the next day's discussion, and he'd expect you to be prepared to discuss them. He directed the discussion, but he didn't control it; he was a good listener and made sure we all had a chance to respond, whether we wanted to or not. If he was pleased with a response, he'd nod his head and smile. Occasionally he'd read a student's essay, praising its good points. But he was toughminded, too, as I suggested before. He really nailed you for careless work or inattention.  When you got an A from him, you really felt good, for he wasn't an easy grader. We used to complain about his grading standards, usually in vain, though he would change a grade if he thought the had been unfair.  We had many interesting discussions about Twain, Crane, and Dreiser, as I recall, but his favorite period was the 1920's. He loved the expatriates : Anderson, Cummings, Hemingway, Fitzgerald.  He was always bringing in books for us to read, but when he got to this period, he was a walking library, I think he'd read every book ever written by or about Hemingway and Fitzgerald in the twenties. Yes, Mr. Jones was a fine teacher all right: he knew his subject.  But more than that, he made us want to continue to read it and study it on our own. Which of the following is TRUE about Mr. Jones' teaching style?"
"Young people and older people do not always agree with each other. They sometimes have different ideas about living, working and playing. But in one special program in New York State, adults and teenagers live together in a friendly way. Each summer 200 teenagers and 50 adults live together for eight weeks as members of a special work group. Everyone works several hours each day. They do so not just to keep busy but to find meaning and enjoyment in work. Some teenagers work in the woods or on the farms near the village. Some learn to make things like tables and chairs and to build houses. The adults teach them these skills. There are several free hours each day. Weekends are free, too. During the free hours some of the teenagers learn photo-taking or painting. Others sit around and talk to sing. Each teenager chooses his own way to spend his free time. When people live together, rules are necessary. In this program the teenagers and the adults make the rules together. If someone breaks a rule, the problem goes before the whole group. They talk about it and ask, ""Why did it happen? What should we do about it?"" One of the teenagers has this to say about the experience: ""You stop thinking only about yourself. You learn how to think about the group."" The best title for the passage is   _  ."
"Science can't explain the power of pets, but many studies have shown that the company of pets can help lower blood pressure   and raise chances of recovering from a heart attack, reduce loneliness and spread all-round good cheer. Any owner will tall you how much joy a pet brings. For some, an animal provides more comfort than a husband/wife. A 2002 study by Karen Allen of the State University of New York measured stress   levels and blood pressure in people - half of them pet owners -while they performed 5 minutes of mental arithmetic   or held a hand in ice water. Subjects completed the tasks alone, with a husband/wife, a close friend or with a pet. People with pets did It best .Those tested with their animal friends had smaller change in blood pressure and returned  Most quickly to baseline heart rates .With pets in the room ,people also made fewer math mistakes  Than when doing in front of other companions. It seems people feel more released around Pets, says Allen, who thinks it may be because pets don't judge. A study reported last fall suggests that having a pet dog not only raises your spirits but may also have an effect on your eating habits. Researchers at Northwestern Memorial Hospital spent a Year studying 36 fat people and were put on a diet-and-exercise programs; a separate group of 56 fat people without pets were put on a diet program. On average,people lost about 11 pounds, Or 5% of their body weight .Their dogs did even better,losing an average of 12 pounds,more then 15%of their body weight .Dog owners didn't lose any more weight than those without dogs but ,say Researchers,got more exercise overall -mostly with their dogs -and found it worth doing.

"Many areas of cropland in Bangladesh are becoming unfit for farming. The land is becoming salty. It is a big problem for the small country which has more than 155 million people because growing crops is the most common way Bangladeshis support themselves. Farmers in the country are learning to grow vegetables in so-called ""vertical gardens. "" The soil in these gardens is better because heavy rains have removed much of the salt. Shobitha Debna is a 35-year-old farmer in the village Chandipur is able to grow hundreds of kilograms of vegetables each season in her small garden. This kind of farming is new in Chandipur. But it may spread across the country.Most of Bangladesh is at or below sea level. Rising seawaters linked to climate change has severely affected the country. High water from storms in coastal areas also add salt to soil. High salt content makes crops less productive. The salty sea water flows into rivers, which then flood Chandipur and other villages. Vegetable crops fail. For three years now, hundreds of villagers have grown crops in vertical gardens. From July to October, about l. 5 meters of rain falls in Bangladesh. The seasonal rains remove salt from the soil. At the end of the rainy season, villagers collect the cleaned soil and place it in large containers. They use that soil to grow vegetables. WorldFish Center, a non-profit International group has trained about 200 villagers in southwestern Bangladesh to make vertical gardens. Over the next two years, the center will train about 5,000 people. A vertical garden is easy to make. Villagers fill containers with good soil and natural fertilizers. They put the containers on bricks so they are off the ground. They add pieces of the bricks to the soil to help water flow and drain. Villagers also grow vegetables in containers made from large, thin pieces of plastic supported by bamboo. This is called ""vertical tower"" which can produce more than 100 kilograms of vegetables each. What can be inferred from the passage?"

"Even kids know that we should wait for the traffic light to turn green before crossing a road, but not everybody follows this basic rule. ""Chinese style road crossing"" has become a hot expression recently. Chinese people ""cross roads without thinking about traffic lights, so long as they are part of a crowd"", said a post on Sina Weibo. A CCTV news program showed that in only an hour, more than 600 people ran red lights when crossing a road in Shijiazhuang, Hebei. Many people say that they jaywalk   because the red light lasts too long. Such an opinion is supported by a research team at Tongji University. The team did research on people's waiting times at different road crossings from 2008 to 2010. They found that Chinese people would wait for 70 to 90 seconds before they lost their patience. ""People are likely to run the red light when the waiting time is longer than they can bear  ,""said Ni Ying, a member of the research team. However, a survey on Sina Weibo shows that nearly half of respondents   believe that people jaywalk mainly because they disregard   rules. ""I always obey  traffic rules. Time is important but safety should come first,""wrote ""Qixiaoe""on Weibo. Many countries give out punishments to jaywalkers. In Singapore, the maximum can be three months in prison. Some Chinese cities have started taking some actions, too. For example, the first three people in a jaywalking group will be fined   50 yuan in Shijiazhuang. But calling on people to respect rules is more important. ""To completely solve the problem, everyone should realize the importance of obeying the traffic rules,""Wang Jianping, a professor at Sichuan University, said to Huaxi Metropolis Daily. Wang Jianping suggests that we should   _   to solve the problem of jaywalking."
"Most people know Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone. But not many know about another talking device (equipment) he invented just four years later, in 1880. He called the device the photophone. ""Photophone"" comes form the Greek words for ""light"" and ""sound"". The photophone did not use electricity to carry sound over wires between two people.  _ . Instead, the photophone used a beam of sunlight traveling through the air. With his invention, Bell could actually transmit   human speech on a beam of light. To do so, he spoke close to a thin mirror that was reflecting sunlight. The vibrations   of his voice caused the mirror to vibrate, and the vibrating mirror caused the light to vibrate. The vibrating light hit a light-sensitive cell in a receiver placed some distance away. The cell changed the light patterns into electrical signals. Earphones changed the signals back into sounds. Bell believed that his idea of talking on a beam of light would prove to be important. He often called the photophone his greatest invention. Even though the photophone depended on a source of energy that was not constant--the sun--Bell wasn't a bit discouraged. He felt sure that people would one day talk using beams of light. Two much more recent developments made Bell's dream come true. In 1960, a scientist built the laser. A laser produces a highly concentrated beam of light. Shortly afterward, other scientists developed a new kind of optical fiber. The optical fiber is a glass thread. The new fiber could carry light beams long distances--as far as several miles.

"It's a long-awaited day for China. The navy now has its first aircraft carrier , Liaoning. It's a unique experience to get to know the life in the carrier. The carrier is just like a small city on the sea. It has all the functions for daily life. There are 4 words to sum up its characters: big, small, much and high. The carrier Liaoning is such a huge one that the total length of the whole corridor could reach over 20 kilometers. But the living space for the sailors is quite small. That's because the carrier is designed for researching purposes, rather than comfortable living. Over 1,000 sailors, both men and women, are living onboard. They are arranged among over 3,000 tiny rooms below the deck.. For visitors, it's so easy to get lost. So the first thing the new sailors have to learn is their way around. The number of female sailors is much less than that of the males, taking about 5 percent of the total. But they play a key role in carrying out some special missions. Also, you will be surprised by the high level of education of today's sailors. The captain said that over 90 percent of the sailors are college graduates. Six hold Doctor's Degrees and 45 have a Master's. The whole team is young but vigorous. The complex work on the carrier requires high management abilities for the commanders onboard . Which of the following is NOT TRUE according to the passage?"
"Mark Twain has been called the inventor of the American novel. And he surely deserves additional praise: the man who popularized the clever literary attack on racism. I say clever because anti-slavery fiction had been the important part of the literature in the years before the Civil War. H. B. Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin is only the most famous example. These early stories dealt directly with slavery. With minor exceptions, Twain planted his attacks on slavery and prejudice into tales that were on the surface about something else entirely. He drew his readers into the argument by drawing them into the story. Again and again, in the postwar years, Twain seemed forced to deal with the challenge of race. Consider the most controversial, at least today, of Twain's novels, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Only a few books have been kicked off the shelves as often as Huckleberry Finn, Twain's most widely read tale. Once upon a time, people hated the book because it struck them as rude. Twain himself wrote that those who banned the book considered the novel ""trash and suitable only for the slums  ."" More recently the book has been attacked because of the character Jim, the escaped slave, and many occurences of the word nigger. (The term Nigger Jim, for which the novel is often severely criticized, never appears in it.) But the attacks were and are silly--and miss the point. The novel is strongly anti-slavery. Jim's search through the slave states for the family from whom he has been forcibly parted is heroic. As J. Chadwick has pointed out, the character of Jim was a first in American fiction--a recognition that the slave had two personalities, ""the voice of survival within a white slave culture and the voice of the individual: Jim, the father and the man."" There is much more. Twain's mystery novel Pudd'nhead Wilson stood as a challenge to the racial beliefs of even many of the liberals of his day. Written at a time when the accepted wisdom held Negroes to be inferior   to whites, especially in intelligence, Twain's tale centered in part around two babies switched at birth. A slave gave birth to her master's baby and, for fear that the child should be sold South, switched him for the master's baby by his wife. The slave's lightskinned child was taken to be white and grew up with both the attitudes and the education of the slave-holding class. The master's wife's baby was taken for black and grew up with the attitudes and intonations of the slave. The point was difficult to miss: nurture  , not nature, was the key to social status. The features of the black man that provided the stuff of prejudice--manner of speech, for example-- were, to Twain, indicative of nothing other than the conditioning that slavery forced on its victims. Twain's racial tone was not perfect. One is left uneasy, for example, by the lengthy passage in his autobiography   about how much he loved what were called ""nigger shows"" in his youth--mostly with white men performing in black-face--and his delight in getting his mother to laugh at them. Yet there is no reason to think Twain saw the shows as representing reality. His frequent attacks on slavery and prejudice suggest his keen awareness that _ did not. Was Twain a racist? Asking the question in the 21st century is as wise as asking the same of Lincoln. If we read the words and attitudes of the past through the ""wisdom"" of the considered moral judgments of the present, we will find nothing but error. Lincoln, who believed the black man the inferior of the white, fought and won a war to free him. And Twain, raised in a slave state, briefly a soldier, and inventor of Jim, may have done more to anger the nation over racial injustice and awaken its collective conscience than any other novelist in the past century. The story of two babies switched mainly indicates that   _  ."

"After my sixth voyage I was quite determined that I would never go to sea. One early spring day, however, I was brought to see the Caliph. He said, ""Sindbad, I have chosen you to deliver a letter and a gift to the King of Serendib in return for his message of friendship."" The Caliph's commandment fell upon me like a thunderbolt . ""Your Majesty,"" I answered, ""I am ready to do all that your Majesty commands, but I have made a promise never again to leave Baghdad."" ""I admit,"" said he, ""that you have indeed had some extraordinary experiences, but I do not see why they should prevent you from doing as I wish. You have only to go straight to Serendib and give my message, and come back as you will."" At last, I agreed. The Caliph was delighted and gave me a thousand sequins (gold coins) for the expenses of the voyage. Soon I sailed quickly and safely to Serendib after a nearly 30-day voyage where I was well received, and brought into the presence of the king. I displayed the Caliph's gifts: a bed which cost a thousand sequins, and more beds of different fashion. The King received the assurance of the Caliph's friendliness with satisfaction. Since my task was accomplished, I was anxious to depart. The king dismissed me with many presents, and I left immediately on the end day of May. On the fifth day we suffered from pirates  who killed some of us and made the rest prisoners of whom I was one. On a distant island they sold us for slaves. I fell into the hands of a rich merchant. The merchant asked me to shoot elephants in the forest. When he left, he said, ""When you have succeeded in killing one come and tell me."" So saying, he gave me a supply of food and returned to the town. I settled myself in the tree and kept watching. The next morning I saw a large group of elephants passing by. I shot one to death and run back to tell my master of my success, for which I was praised and regaled(,) with good things. Then we went back to bury the elephant I had killed, in order that when it became a skeleton my master might return and keep its tusks safely. I hunted for two months. One morning as I watched the coming of the elephants which paused instead of passing the tree, trumpeting(,) horribly. I was terrified. The largest of the animals brought me to the ground .I thought now that my last hour was surely come; but the huge creature, picking me up gently enough; set me upon its back, then turned into the forest. After what seemed a long time to me, I was standing on a great hill where there was filled with bones and tusks of elephants which are more than I could carry away in a lifetime. I run to my master's house, and was received by him with joyful surprise. He asked me what had happened to me and why I was still alive. I soon satisfied his curiosity, and the next day we went together to the Ivory Hill, and he was overjoyed to find as many tusks. He said, ""My brother, these wild elephants have killed numbers of our slaves every year. You alone have escaped; therefore you must be under the special protection of Heaven. You deserve your liberty, and I will give you a fortune."" I only asked liberty to return to my own country ""Well,"" he answered, ""the monsoon will soon bring the ivory ships here, and then I will send you on your way."" So I stayed with him till the time of the monsoon. When the ships at last arrived, my master put on board for me a great store of supply, also lots of ivory, and said me goodbye. I left without feeling at ease upon the sea after what had happened. I sold my ivory and bought many expensive presents. I joined a traveling team of merchants. Our journey was long and boring, but gradually, I did not to fear storms, or pirates, or any of the other dangers. When the fall wind came blowing, we reached Baghdad.  I brought myself to the Caliph and told him everything about my experience. My story was written in letters of gold, and laid up among his treasures. I took my leave of him, well satisfied with the honors and rewards he gave me; and since that time I have rested from my labors, and given myself up wholly to my family and my friends.

"A team of researchers in the UK has shown that children who were taken to the library more often and owned more books at two years old achieved higher scores in school tests when they began primary school. The research also showed that although social background has a noticeable effect on a child's readiness for school, attending pre-school and having their parents teach them a wide range of activities have a positive effect---while extended exposure to television lowers their scores. ""One message coming through loud and clear is that how a child learns in his very early years is critical   for a smooth transition into the educational system,"" said Professor James Law. ""This is a very positive message, as it gets us away from the belief that a child's educational future is pre-determined by standard measures of socio-economic disadvantage, such as income, housing, or the mother's education."" Data from the study shows that children from a positive communication environment had a better expressive vocabulary by their second birthday. These children went on to achieve higher scores in language, reading and maths tests when they entered school. In the early years, the communication environment was a better predictor of children's success with language than their general social background. Most children develop speech and language effortlessly, but some are slow to acquire these skills and go on to struggle with literacy   and academic skills throughout their schooling. This project set out to uncover what factors contributed to these problems. Professor Sue Roulstone said, ""These findings are an encouragement to all parents to provide a positive communication environment for their children from the very start of their lives. The project did identify particular aspects of the communication environment, such as having children's books around and not having the television on too much. But the main message is that, as parents, we can have an impact on how our children learn to talk by providing a range of communication experiences. And the better our children are at talking by the age of two years, the better they will do when they start school."" From the research, Professor James Law concluded that   _  ."

"There is a long history behind the first T-shirts and today's colorful outerwear . Many stories talk about the first T-shirts and the reason why people wear them. One says the first T-shirt had something to do with war. In World War I Some American soldiers found that European soldiers' undershirts  were cooler and more comfortable. They started to wear the same kind. Because the design of the undershirts was simple and looked like the letter T, Americans called the clothes T-shirts. By World War II Many soldiers started to wear T-shirts as under-wear. In the 1930s  Many American students started wearing white T-shirts for playing sports. In 1951   Marlon Brando, a very famous American actor, wore a tight-fitting  T-shirt in a film. After this, many American men started to dress like him. In the 1970s  T-shirts became the favorite kind of clothing for young people in many countries. At that time, they were a sign of being cool and different from others. In the 1980s  T-shirts started to be hot in China. Now many young people show their own ideas on their T-shirts; special pictures, funny words... T-shirts are more like artworks than just simple summer wear Why are T-shirts more like artworks than just simple summer wear now?"
"While many young people may resist getting a ""real job"" or becoming independent, these are the things that make you happy and give you purpose. Some people underestimate the satisfaction of working, thinking they'll be miserable. The 20-somethings that do work are happier than those who don' t or are underemployed. If you invest in your career early,you'll have longer to build it up. 70% of wage growth happens in the first 10 years, so you need to get the best job you can get and negotiate your salary. No one can be sure that people who will wait until their 30s to get going are expecting to experience later to catch up with those of their ages. Many 20-somethings don't know what they want to do, so they hang around the house or in. low-level jobs waiting for the spirit to move them. Not making a choice is a choice. These 20-somethings think they are keeping their options open, but they are actually closing doors. Resumes start to look thin, their peers  begin surpassing them and they may get stuck in underemployment. It will take about 10,000 hours(or about five years)to really master their jobs. If you're wondering why colleagues seem so smart and confident, it's partly because they've been doing it longer. Young people should learn as much as they can in their first jobs and remember it will take some time to really get good. The 20-something brain is still developing, which is in charge of critical emotion with reason. This, _ less on-the-job experience, means 20-somethings are more sensitive to surprise and criticism. They are more likely to take feedback personally. Step back and get some perspective. You're not going to be fired because your boss is angry. Hear the criticism and learn from it. The brain doesn't fully mature until your mid-20s, particularly the parts that plan for the future and manage emotions. That doesn't mean you should sit around and wait for it to develop. In. fact, what you learn and experience in your 20s becomes hardwired into your brain and this is the best chance you have to change your brain and change how you think and react. What people do in their 20s determines who they'll be as adults. What can we infer from the whole passage?"

"It is not unusual for people to speak two or three languages; they're known as bilinguals or trilinguals. Speakers of more than three languages are known as polyglots. And when we refer to people who speak many languages, perhaps a dozen or more, we use the term hyper-polyglot. The most famous hyper-polyglot was Giuseppe Mezzofanti, a 19thcentury Italian cardinal, who was said to speak 72 languages. This claim sounds absurd. _ But Mezzofanti was tested by critics, and they were all impressed. Did Mezzofanti have an extraordinary brain? Or are hyper-polyglots just ordinary people with ordinary brains who manage to do something extraordinary through hard work? U.S. linguist Stephen Drashen believes that outstanding language learners just work harder at it and then they acquire unusually strong language ability. As an example, he mentions a Hungarian woman who worked as an interpreter during the 20thcentury. When she was 86, she could speak 16 languages and was still working on learning new languages. She said she learned them mostly on her own, reading fiction or working through dictionaries or textbooks. Some researchers argue to the contrary. They believe that there is such a thing as a talent for learning languages. In the 1930s, a German scientist examined parts of the preserved brain of a hyper-polyglot named Emil Krebs, who could speak 60 languages fluently. The scientist found that the area of Krebs's brain called Broca's area, which is associated with language, looked different from the Broca's area in the brains of men who speak only one language. However, we still don't know if Krebs was born with a brain ready to learn dozens of languages or if his brain adapted to the demands he put on it. Although it is still not clear whether the ability to learn many languages is in born, there's no doubt that just about all of us can acquire skills in a second, third, or even fourth language by putting our mind to it. The Hungarian woman became a hyper-polyglot mainly because of her   _  ."
"There are two ways to save money traveling. The first way is to get _ on the specific things you want. There is a limitation to this type of approach (,) though. If you find the lowest price on the best hotel in Honolulu at the height of the season, you will save money, but still have a very expensive vacation. Trying to get exactly what you want will generally be an expensive proposition, in travel and in life. The other approach is to be a true opportunist. This will be difficult for some of you, and entirely unacceptable to others. Nonetheless  ,the travelers who get to travel the most, go to the widest variety of places, learn the most and do the most, are the opportunists. This will be true until you are so wealthy that you have no monetary (;)limits. The first time I went to Ecuador, I went there because it was cheap. If it wasn't, I would have had a great time--somewhere else. The trip lasted a month, and cost $1045, which included airfare and even the $130 fee for a guide to take me to the top or glacier   covered Mount Chimborazo. I cut the cost by taking a bus from my home in Michigan to Miami, and back again when I returned from Ecuador. The round-trip ticket cost $158. The round-trip flight to Quito from Miami was only $256, because it was a courier (,) flight, which meant I signed for some luggage(car parts), and  could only take carry-on luggage. Never did I feel deprived, or bored. I had a great time, eating wherever it was cheap and clean, doing all sorts of inexpensive, but interesting things, and traveling across the country to climb Chimborazo. I also met and fell in love with my wife Ana. Being an opportunist means you'll have just as much variety, and probably almost everything you want--eventually. You just have to stop trying to get exactly what you want exactly when you want it. If the guide that took me up Chimborazo hadn't dropped his price from $200 to $130, I would have spent $2 for a bus and gone hiking on EI Altar, another great Andean mountain. That would have left me with enough money for several other minor adventures. It's suggested that the author   _  ."

"Rome wasn't built in a day, and the Internet didn't come out of a golden egg. Many of today's creations were not born of people who had creative ideas, but who did not stop at simply having an idea. They took one brick of capital  , another brick of knowledge, perhaps a brick or two of family and friends, and built their empires   brick by brick. If you want to build an online empire, you cannot settle for simply having a website full of articles, or a website full of pictures--there are already thousands of sites like that, so you need to come up with something new and creative. So if you are starting to build something up, ask yourself: what do you really want to do, and what are you really good at? Believe it or not, you can make money at something that you are an expert in, and you need to know what that is. Remember, having an online empire does not mean that you have to do it alone. You can take _ along with you. Having a friend advertise your services online is a good way to attract more visitors to your empire. Building an online empire, you will have to be prepared to not only come up with creative ideas, but to carry your ideas through. Talk to people who have already succeeded in building their own empires. Talk to people who are struggling. Join a mailing list that will help you get through your struggle to achieve your goal. As you move forward, you will find that you can help other people, and you will have a good many stories to tell--not to mention a lot of money in the bank. If you learn the real secrets of creating a long term stable   online business then you will have enough money to retire on. Which of the following would be the best title for this passage?"
"Because of the stress and strains of modern life folks today would rather watch television than get together with neighbors. Their behavior doesn't mirror TV soaps like Coronation Street and East Enders. The Street's Ashley Peacock and Toyah Battersby know all their neighbors. But the Royal Mail survey shows that real-life under35s wouldn't dream of popping next door for a chat or to borrow a cup of sugar. Three out of ten say they wouldn't know their neighbors if they saw them in the street. The same proportion would only offer to help neighbors if absolutely necessary, while thirty-onepercent don't want to get to know them better. Twenty-six percent rarely or never speak to the person next door. Thirty-five percent only talk to neighbors occasionally, and six percent actively dislike them. The older generation are still sociable, with seventy percent of over55s taking time to chat to people next door. The report says: ""In the past, the British tradition of village green gossip between neighbors was celebrated worldwide. But there's been a clear shift away from local links by the young generation."" Londoners are least likely to be neighbors, with a third rarely or never chatting over the garden fence. People in the Midlands--where 65 percent often speak to their neighbors are most friendly.

"Liu Qian, a magician from Taiwan, cast his spell over an audience of thousands on the CCTV Spring Festival Show. Die-hard fans are still trying to work out the secrets behind many of the tricks he performed. But Liu, 32, when asked, laughed off the idea that there might be an ""answer"" to his magic. ""The most fascinating things about magic is the puzzling process. People enjoy how magicians make the impossible come true,"" said Liu. Few people today believe in the possibility of real magic. They also often fail to consider magicians' devotion to their art. It can take a magician years' of practice to perfect a trick before he performs it on stage. Part of Liu's star appeal is his astonishing skill. However, when he began in the industry, he was embarrassingly clumsy. ""I could practice thousands of times for one single act. It wasn't much fun,"" he said. No magician's supernatural powers on stage extend to their life off stage. Liu says his life was no easier or funnier because he was a magician. He developed an interest in magic at a young age, but didn't consider making a living out of it until he graduated from university. He had studied Japanese language and found himself unable to find a job. ""My parents never considered being a magician as a proper job. To begin with, I had little confidence I would be doing this in the long term,"" he said. Yet Liu felt a powerful calling to become a magician. ""For many people, magic somehow means a miracle, which is something we all secretly wish for no matter how hard-bitten or cynical  we become,"" he said. Liu may be right. A popular modern dream is of the fairy godmother, who waves her magic wand   and makes our dreams come true. But according to Liu, we all have the power to create magic in our lives. As Liu puts it: it's not the magic that makes it work;it's the way we work that makes it magic. What is the best title for the passage?"

"New York City was dealing with a growing public health threat Sunday after tests confirmed that eight students at a private Catholic high school had contracted the same strain( type ) of the swine flu that has ravaged  Mexico. Some of the school's students had visited Cancun on a spring break trip two weeks ago. Officials reported 68 U.S. cases of swine flu in five states so far, with the latest in Ohio and New York. Unlike in Mexico, cases in the United State have been mild and U.S. health authorities can't yet explain why. In New York City, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that there were 45 cases, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. About 100 students at St. Francis Preparatory School complained of flu-like symptoms; further tests will determine how many of those cases are swine flu. St. Francis is the largest private Catholic high school in the nation, with 2,700 students. The school canceled classes on Monday and Tuesday in response to the outbreak. Bloomberg stressed that the New York cases were mild and many are recovering, but said that some family members of students also had flu symptoms. In Mexico, health officials say a strain of swine flu has killed up to 160 people and sickened over 2,000. New York officials said the flu strain discovered in the patients here is the same strain as in Mexico, though all the New York cases are mild. Swine flu is a respiratory   disease of pigs caused by type A flu viruses. Human cases are uncommon but can occur in people who are around pigs. It also can be spread from person to person. Symptoms include a high fever, body aches, coughing, sore throat and respiratory congestion . Which is the main idea of the article?"
"It is well known that Albert Einstein was one of the greatest scientists of all time and he was also a really great person. Here are some interesting things about him. When Einstein started to work in America, someone asked him what he needed. He said he needed a desk, some paper and a pencil. He also asked for a big waste-paper basket to hold all of his mistakes. This shows that he knew even the cleverest man in the world can only learn by making mistakes. Einstein regarded time as very important. He never wore socks and he thought putting on socks was a waste of time as people already wore shoes. He also thought it was a waste of time remembering things that could quickly be found in a book. That's why he never remembered his own phone number, which was in the phone book. He knew what was worth remembering. It is true that if we are going to do great things in our lives, we can not waste our time. Einstein liked to joke too. Once in an exam a student asked him why all the questions were the same as last year's. Einstein replied the questions were the same but the answers were different! ,A, B, C, D,,. In one exam, Einstein   _  ."
"One day when I came home at lunch time the Jonas Brothers, Kevin, Joe, and Nick, were at my door. I jumped out of my Range Rover and started screaming. I ran up to them and just started hugging them and crying. I had no clue what was going on. They were just smiling and laughing. I was speechless and I was just staring at them. We stood there in dead silence for a couple of minutes. I finally picked up courage to say, ""Hey, would you all like to come in?"" They told me yes and that they had something to tell me. I brought them in and asked them why they came to my house. They told me, ""We need you for something. We would like you to join the band; we want you to be our background dancer. You will also be a dancer for Miley Cyrus."" Hearing their words, my jaw dropped in amazement. We kept talking for a while. I skipped school for the rest of the day, because it was the Jonas Brothers! We sat and watched television for a while, and then I went to my room and got ready. Then later that day we went and got lunch and went to a movie. We had to go to private places to go to the movie and eat because of all of the fans, but we had a great time! They brought me home that night and told me that they would see me tomorrow. Once I got home and got out of the car, Nick got out too and walked me to the door! He told me goodnight and gave me a hug and went back to the car. That night I could hardly go to sleep, but I finally did. The next morning I woke up and got ready really quickly. Then the Jonas Brothers' driver came and picked me up in their black Range Rover. I got in the back seat and by surprise Nick was there with flowers and chocolate. I asked him, ""What is this?"" He said, ""It's for you! I want to surprise you! Today we are going to go to the studio and you are going to start learning everything for the tour this year. Kevin and Joe are already at the studio, I just want to come here and pick you up. After that I have something special planned for us!"" ""I don't have any clothes to wear, except for the clothes that I am wearing to practice,"" I said. He told me, ""It's okay, we are going shopping to find outfits for our special date."" We went shopping for our clothes and I got to pick anything I wanted and Nick paid for all of it. Then that night we went and ate at a restaurant right by the beach. After dinner, we went and walked on the beach. It was amazing! That night he took me home and walked me to my door and we said goodnight. I then went in and went to bed right away. The next few months I went to the studio with them about every day. It was a lot of hard work, but once the tour started, it paid off. I had the best time of my life. Once the tour was over, I got more into the acting and dancing business, I then became famous. Miley Cyrus and I became best friends and I also was a background dancer for her. Miley, the Jonas Brothers, and I were all best friends and we pretty much grew up together. Now, Miley and I are still best friends, and Nick Jonas and I are married. We are still famous and have the best time of our life. It can be inferred from the text that     ."

"The 1800s saw many firsts, including the invention of the bicycle and ready-to-eat cereal. Another interesting event also debuted  in the 1800s. In 1888, the world's first beauty contest was held in Spa, Belgium. Though little is known about that first competition, the idea caught on. Today, beauty contests can be found in countries from Argentina to Zambia. Most people agree that the business of beauty contests began in America. In 1921, local businessmen in Atlantic City, New Jersey, wanted summer tourists to stay longer. So they came up with the idea of beauty pageant. The pageant was successful, and 100,000 tourists stayed to see the first ""Miss America"" crowned. After a few years, the annual event no longer focused only on girl's beauty. A talent competition was added in 1938. And not long after that, college scholarships became the official contest prize. These were just the beginning of the changes for the beauty contest industry. www.ks5u.com From the mid-to late-20th century, beauty contests began popping up everywhere. In 1951, the Miss World Pageant got its start in London. Over time, this contest has changed its focus from beauty alone to beauty and intelligence. Miss Universe began in 1952,Miss International in 1960 and Miss Earth in 2001. Today, these still are considered the four most famous international beauty contests. Through the years, controversy has surrounded beauty contests. Many people have objected to women competing in swimsuits as it only calls attention to one's looks. Outside pressure and changes in society, therefore, brought about changes in the beauty contest world. Today, women are judged on areas other than just appearance. These include intelligence, speaking ability, poise and talent. The women who compete in the pageants are often asked why they do it. Many say it's because the contests build their confidence and public speaking skills and offer scholarships. Today, millions of women worldwide compete for these very reasons.

The gunman, named in media reports as Adam Lanza, killed his mother before driving to the school and opening fire. Six adults, all women, were also killed before the gunman shot himself dead. The head teacher at Sandy Hook school in Newtown, Dawn Hochsprung, is listed among the dead, along with adults Rachel DaVino, Anne Marie Murphy, Lauren Russo, Mary Sherlach and Victoria Soto.

"A ""blogger"" is a person who writes on an Internet website called a ""blog"". The word ""blog"" is a short way of saying ""web log"", or ""personal website"". Anyone can start a blog, and they can write about anything they like. There are millions of blogs on the Internet today. They provide news, information and ideas to the people who read them.They contain links to other websites.And they provide a place for people to write their ideas and react to the ideas of others. A research company called Perseus has studied more than 3,000 web logs. It says that blogs are most popular with teenage girls. They use them to let their friends know what is happening in their lives. The study also says that more than 100,000 bloggers stopped taking part in the activity after a year. However, some people develop serious blogs to present political and other ideas. For example, the Republican and Democratic parties in the southern state of Kentucky recently started their own blogs. And American companies are beginning to use blogs to advertise their products. At thesame time, some long-standing blogs have ended. Last week, blogging leader Dave Winer closed his free blog service ""weblogs.com"". He said the site became too costly to continue.

"Just before Mother's Day I purchased the Flex Belt for my mother to help her lose some weight. I wasn't sure if she was going to like the present but she seemed to love it. I saw the Flex Belt review on the Internet by chance and was very impressed with what I read. It seems that the Flex Belt is helping thousands of people achieve their weight loss goals. I asked my mother a few questions about the Flex Belt such as whether this product was easy to use, whether she felt painful while using it and the most important question was whether she lost any weight. She told me that it was so easy to use, and that even a child could operate it. She also said that in the first period of using this product she did feel that it was a little bit magical and she was pleased with the amount of weight she had lost. Over the past few years it seems that my fitness routine  has gone downhill . I used to enjoy going to my local gym to do a bit weight lifting, or enjoy meeting up with friends once a week for a game of soccer. Recently I noticed that I became a bit ""round"", so I have started to do some exercise by taking a thirty-to-forty-minute run every morning. I feel like the weight that I have put on especially around my midsection is slowly dropping off. Everyone knows the benefits of having a slim waist but it seems that we don't actually do anything about trying to achieve this. There are a few reasons for this, such as lack of time, not being motivated  enough, or not having enough money to join a gym. So this is the reason I think the Flex Belt is great to own.

"Oscar-winning director Ang Lee' s new epic ""Life of Pi"" reveals the relationship between a teenage Indian boy and a Bengal tiger. But in reality, the predators are under increasing threat from humans. Animal rights group PETA is hoping to use the popularity of the film to focus people's attention on the real life of Bengal tigers. With the rising demand for tiger parts from East Asia, illegal hunting remains a tremendous danger for the remaining cat population. Back in 1947, there were 40,000 tigers in India, but the number is experiencing a sharp decline t0 1,706 despite campaigns to protect the animal. Rising man-animal conflict is also one of the leading causes of decline in tiger numbers. In one of numerous reported attacks on the endangered big cats, villagers near The Bangladesh-India border, armed with sticks and boat oars, set upon the animal suspected to have attacked a local fisherman and beat it to death earlier this month. So far this year, 58 tiger deaths have been reported in the country. ""The first instinct when a tiger is spotted is to just kill it,""grieved Gurmeet Sapal, a wildlife filmmaker. ""The feeling of fear and revenge is so strong that it shuts out any other emotion. What we don' t realize is that the tiger never attacks humans until it is forced to. ""' India has been struggling to stop the tiger's decline in the face of the loss of habitat as well that encourages the animals to leave the forest for food. "" The tiger's rapidly exhausted prey base causes the predator to go al! out to get its food. Consequently, livestock and human beings become easy prey, which leads inevitably to conflict,"" says a wildlife conservationist. Filmmaker Sapal says it is only normal for people to think of the tiger as a dangerous animal, but its image as a human killer bears some injustice. ""Tigers never kill for sport nor store meat. They kill their prey only in case of hunger. "" What contributes to the facts that livestock and human beings become easy target of tigers?"

The family decided to donate Tyler's organs, a choice she believes her kind and considerate son would have made on his own. It's also a choice that transplant programs wish would be made more often, because the need for donor organs is far more than the supply worldwide. More than 1,500 people in Ontario are on the waiting list for life-saving organs, and one dies every day because an organ has not become available in time. Across Canada, the gap between donations and the need for organs continues to widen. At the end of 2010, more than 4,400 Canadians were on the waiting list for donor organs, including 3,362 needing a kidney. That year, 229 died before the organs they needed became available. LeBlanc recalls the morning when her son was taken off life support and his organs were removed. Despite living what she calls a parent's absolute worst nightmare, LeBlanc says she has got the strength to bear such an unbearable loss. ""He's still there. He's still living. And he's still breathing. And he's brought so much joy to families,"" she says. ""He's my hero. He really is my hero."" Tyler was struck by the truck mainly because  _  ."

"Local businessmen are increasingly facing competition from online retailers. Larry Pollock, owner of Camera Co/Op on South Congress, said he has been dealing with this kind of problem for years, even before the Internet. The struggle began with mail-order catalogues , which are similar to online retailers in that they have few employees to pay, no sales tax fees and no business venue to lease and manage. ""Their overhead is lower, but they don't offer a service like we do,"" Pollock said. Pollock, however, said providing a valuable service to customers does not always guarantee continued sales. ""We spend 30 minutes to an hour with somebody and they go home and buy it on line,"" he said. According to the state comptroller's office, online shopping is developing at a more rapid rate than traditional businesses. In spite of how fair or unfair online shopping may be to the local businessmen, consumers will continue to turn to the Internet for its variety and accessibility, said Mitch Wilson, an online shopper. ""You have a larger selection and it's easier to compare prices."" Wilson said he built his personal computer and paid a third of the price by shopping on line. ""Before the Internet, I would have had to go and buy an assembled computer from somebody like Dell,"" he said. ""Before I started shopping on line I could never find all the pieces I wanted. No single store had everything needed, so shopping on line saved me from having to buy from Dell."" Janny Brazeal, a psychology freshman, said online shopping is too impersonal. ""'d rather see it in person, touch it, know that I'm getting it,"" she said. Brazeal also said she would not give out her credit card number or other personal information on line no matter how safe the site claims it is. Larry Pollock has been facing the problem   _  ."

"A heartless thief is believed to have crashed a fund-raiser and made off with a bag of cash meant to help a New York City firefighter pay for life-changing surgery for his 9-year-old son. But little Aidan Sullivan -- who was born with a facial defect and no right ear -- yesterday put up a brave front, with a message for the crook(thief): ""I'm going to kick your butt!"" ""I want to look normal,"" said Aidan, whose father, Tim, is a firefighter in the Bronx. The third-grader has hemi facial micro soma, in which one half of the face doesn't develop correctly. Last weekend, family friend Peter Drake, a Ridgefield, Conn., firefighter, hosted a fund-raiser, collecting between $8,000 and $9,000. But when the party at a Danbury, Conn., Irish cultural center was over, the money had disappeared. ""At the end of the night, all the money that was donated was put in a zippered bag,"" said Tim Sullivan. ""A bartender gave the bag to Pete... He had it in his hands. He put it down to go do something, and when he came back, he saw that it was missing."" Sullivan said his longtime friend -- who has had fund-raisers to pay for Aidan's 10 previous surgeries -- is ""devastated."" ""Pete was so upset. He kept saying, 'I let Aidan down, I let Aidan down,"" Colleen Sullivan, 40, recalled. ""We even went Dumpster diving, in case it was thrown out."" The Sullivans plan to go ahead with the March 1 surgery led by specialists at NYU's Langone Medical Center in Manhattan. The money would have offset the $10,000 to $15,000 that insurance doesn't cover. Yesterday, Aidan said he's not a fan of hospitals and doesn't like to be away from his sister, Kaylee, 4. But he's willing to do it. ""I'm excited,"" he said. ""Finally, an ear."" What is the money used for according to this text?"
"Zoe Chambers was a successful PR(Public Relations) consultant and life was going well--she had a great job, a beautiful life in London. Then one evening in June last year, she received a text message telling her she was out of work. ""The first two weeks were the most difficult to live through,"" she said. ""After everything I'd done for the company, they dismiss me by text! I was so angry and I just didn't feel like looking for another job. I hated everything about the city and my life."" Then, Zoe received an invitation from an old school friend, Kathy, to come and stay. Kathy and her husband, Huw, had just bought a farm in north west Wales. Zoe jumped at the chance to spend a weekend away from London, and now, then months later, she is still on the farm. ""The moment I arrived at Kathy's farm, I loved it and I knew I wanted to stay."" said Zoe. ""Everything about my past life suddenly seemed meaningless."" Zoe has been working on the farm since October of last year and says she has no regrets. ""It's a hard life, physically very tiring."" she says. ""In London I was stressed and often mentally exhausted. But this is a good, healthy tiredness. Here, all I need to put me in a good mood is a hot bath and on of Kathy's wonderful dinners."" Zoe says she has never bored on the farm. Every day brings a new experience. Kathy has been teaching her how to ride a horse and she has learnt to drive a tractor. Since Christmas, she has been helping with the lambing-watching a lamb being born is unbelievable. She says, ""It's one of the most moving experiences I've ever had.

"There is a sign at a Korean university asking tourists not to step into the grass to take photos. The sign is not written in Korean or English; it is written in Chinese. These signs, and signs in other countries warning Chinese tourists about their behavior, have shamed many Chinese who worry about the image of the country. Over 70 million Chinese tourists made overseas trips last year and spent $102 billion, more than the $84 billion spent by American and German tourists. For many Chinese tourists, it was their first trip abroad and they didn't know about foreign ways. And some of these tourists took their bad habits from China with them. Wang Yang, a Chinese deputy prime minister , said, ""They(the tourists) speak loudly in public, carve words or numbers on tourist attractions, cross the road when the traffic lights are still red and spit anywhere. It damages  the image of the Chinese people and has a very bad influence."" Before you travel to a foreign country, it's important to learn some things about the country and its culture. You are guests in the country and it's important to respect  your hosts. As more and more Chinese visit foreign countries, their behavior will certainly change and those shameful signs will, hopefully, disappear. The sign at a Korean university is written in   _  ."
"If I ask you to shut your eyes and gave you a piece of apple to eat, would you be able to tell me what it is just by tasting it? Of course, you could. Your tongue is covered with tiny ""taste buds"" which help you know what different foods taste like. Do you know that foods would taste different if you did not have a nose? This experiment shows how important your nose is when you taste things. What You Need: * a friend to help * small pieces of any food like carrot, orange, banana * small pieces of apple, raw  potato, and onion What You Do: There are actually three different experiments. You and your friend should take turns to try them on each other. Experiment 1: Have your friend close her eyes and open her mouth. Give her a piece of the food and ask her to taste it. Then, ask her what she thinks it is. She will probably guess correctly. Experiment 2: While your friend has her eyes closed, give her a piece of the raw potato. At the same time, hold a piece of apple right under her nose. Ask her to eat the potato (but don't call it by name) and tell you what she thinks it is. She will say it is a piece of apple! Experiment 3: (for the brave) Take a piece of raw onion. You don't have to close your eyes this time. Squeeze your nose closed with your other hand so that no smells can get into your nose. Now take a nibble of the onion. Surprise! As long as you hold your nose, you will not be able to taste the onion. The Science Secret You already know the science secret. Your nose and your tongue work together to make food taste the way it does. Your tongue, however, can taste only certain flavors like salty, bitter, sour, and sweet. All of the other ""tastes"" are actually ""smells,"" and you need your nose to ""taste"" them. Oh, and you might use this science secret the next time you are told to eat something you don't like the taste of. If you hold your nose while you eat it, you won't ""taste"" it at all.

"Mathilda,15, is Turkana, a native people that has survived by raising cattle in a semiarid   region.  Mathilda's school, like most schools in the area, doesn't have access to clean water and sanitation facilities for its students. So instead of spending their whole school day learning, Mathilda and her classmates start their day by spending two hours to the closest river fetching water ---water that is anyway most likely not safe to drink. They do the same thing again in the afternoon, so they often lose around half of their school day fetching water. Mathilda has to do the same thing outside of school hours to get the water her family needs at home, leaving her little time for studying. Because of rising temperatures, water has become harder and harder to find here, and people have to spend more and more time trying to find it. This is just one small example of how climate change is making it harder to realize people's rights to water, education and security. Unfortunately, most higher-income countries remained silent on the issue. This is despite studies showing that communities already facing marginalization ,such as women and children, mostly suffer from climate change. This is especially the case for those in countries with limited resources and fragile ecosystems. Meanwhile, women consist of the majority of the world 's poor,and so are more dependent for their livelihood on natural resources that are threatened by climate change. And around the world, women and girls are the most likely to be responsible for fetching water for their families. This exposes them to danger and leaves them with less time to attend school, earn money, or simply to rest. But the fact is that the effects of climate change will be felt globally. Despite the difficulties she is facing, trying to get an education, Mathilda says she hopes to serve her community in a leadership role when she grows up. ""All of the world's leaders need to work together to solve this problem that we are all facing,"" she said. The passage is mainly about the problem caused by  _  ."
"Long before the scientific world became concerned about the impacts of introducing nonnative species,a total of l00 starlings were released in New York City's Central Park.Eugene Schieffelin was a Shakespeare lover who wanted to bring to America as manv birds as possible mentioned by the Bard in his poems.He imported 60 starlings and released them on a March day in Central Park.A year later,he introduced an additional 40 birds.  Within 50 years,they had spread to every state,and today they number an estimated 200 million.In San Diego County,the starling seems at home in both urban and agricultural environments,frequently feeding on the ground,where it probes lawns and fields for insects,worms and snails.  Nesting begins in March and peaks in May when the young birds join large flocks in places like Lake Henshaw,dairy farms or Ramona Grasslands.They frequently take over the nest of other birds,and they don't seem particular,having been observed nesting in many kinds of trees.  In addition to competing with native species for food and nesting locations,there have been estimates that starlings cause at least MYM800 million in crop damage annually.Much of the damage they cause is the result of their concentrations.Massive flocks of birds are, though beautiful,can be destructive,even dangerous to aircraft,with more than 800 incidents reported by the Federal Aviation Administration.  Despite their bad press,the starling is popular with bird--watchers and also the Shakespeare lovers,who often refer to the starling probably because the bird is quite an imitator.It can imitate the calls of up to 20 other species,including hawks,robins and flickers.  Love him or hate him,Schieffelin's release of 100 European starlings had a lasting impact in the United States.He had no idea that he also proved the famous words of Shakespeare.""What's done cannot be undone.''

"Here are many kinds of vacations. People can go traveling abroad or spend their holidays at the seaside. One kind of vacation is camping. Many Americans enjoy going camping because it is good for them. Each summer millions of Americans drive to the countryside where they find places to camp. There are a lot of national parks in the USA and these national parks mostly stand on the mountains. They are people's favorite camping places.      Campers are free from the busy life in the noisy and crowded city. They throw themselves into the arms of Mother Nature. They enjoy the fresh air, lakes and forests in these parks. Hiking, swimming and fishing are the main kinds of exercise. They can see different sorts of animals and plants there.      Some campers have trailers which they pull behind their cars to the camping places. Trailers are like small houses on wheels, having many of the things that people use in their homes, such as electricity, hot water, kitchen tools and things like that. But most campers don't have trailers. Tent campers lead a very simple but healthy life.      Camping is a pleasant sports activity. After living a while in the open, campers become as fresh as paintings. They feel relaxed. According to the passage, what do many Americans get from camping?"

"Great white sharks! Just hearing that name _ . In reality, these big fish have more to fear from us than we do from them. For many years, people killed countless great white sharks in the waters around the United States. But thanks to conservation   efforts, great whites are making a comeback in the U.S. Two recent studies show that the population of these sharks is rising along the east and west coast. Why is the growing population of a killer fish something to celebrate? ""When you fish too many of them, you start to lose balance in the environment,"" says shark researcher Tobey Curtis. As the biggest killer, sharks help keep the populations of fish, seals, and other creatures they eat from growing too large. In spite of their importance, great white sharks had long been hunted for their meat and their fins  . Then, in 1997, the U.S. government passed a law that didn't allow the hunting of great whites. Afterwards, the numbers of these sharks in the U.S. waters started to increase. The law wasn't the only thing that has helped great whites. Conservationists have also played a part in the sharks' comeback. The research group OCEARCH is using a method called tagging   to help change people's attitudes about great white. They let the public follow each shark as it travels the world's oceans. OCEARCH also gives each tagged shark a name to help people form a closer connection with the big fish. The group's most well-known shark is named Katharine. She was tagged last year near Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Since then, thousands of people have tracked Katharine's movements on Twitter and the OCEARCH website. This helps people see sharks in a new way. Chris Fischer, the founder of OCEARCH believes learning to appreciate great whites will encourage people to do more to protect them. The law passed in 1997   _  ."
"When I grew up, all the schools in the village demanded that girls cut their hair. The teachers would measure our hair and make sure it was not too long. I remember crying and begging as the scissors cut my hair. My dad told me that a girl who was in school needed to concentrate on books and that hair was a distraction  . I cut my hair all the way through primary school and middle school. Then I went to a high school that allowed long hair but no styles or braids   during class hours. Even then, still adhering to   my dad's words, I never wore my hair long. When I graduated from high school, I started growing my hair. I spent hours looking in the mirror and shaping my hair. My sister complained, wondering why I had to have two styles in a day. In college I heard the word perm  . Girls had some strong chemicals   put on their heads and made the hair look beautiful. I quickly sat in a salon   and changed my hair. I returned to the salon once every month. Even during the days when I had no money for food, I had to find money for my hair. After college, I was jobless and broke. I had to have my hair cut. At that time I saw a bald   black model. Her style shocked me and I admired her so much that I began to follow her. Therefore, there I was. I wore some large earrings and walked around like a model. And many people admired my style. At this point the journey with my hair stopped completely. I decided to have natural hair. I soon found out natural hair is the cheapest, easiest and healthiest way to wear African hair. When did the author wear long hair?"
"Below is a housing guide for students going to London. University accommodation  offices Many university accommodation offices have their own list of registered landlords  . Others also provide information on accommodation agencies and other housing organizations. The advantage of using your university accommodation office is that you can get some support if you have a problem. The disadvantage is that they are unlikely to have enough registered landlords to houses all their students. Property papers: Loot and Renting Loot is an important source   of information about private housing for co-renters. The offers are from private landlords, agencies and individuals looking for other co-renters. They also have a website: www.loot.com. The advantage of using Loot is that there are some excellent bargains. The disadvantage is that there is no quality control over the offers. Renting is another useful paper. The offers in this paper are mainly from accommodation agencies. Their website is at www.renting.co.uk. Accommodation agencies The majority of rented accommodation in London is probably advertised through accommodation agencies. The advantage of using accommodation agencies is that: you will have access to a large number of accommodations. A good agent will listen to your requirements and can save you time in looking for the right accommodation. The disadvantage is that they will make a range of charges to potential renters. Noticeboards Around the universities you will find a number of noticeboards where offers of accommodation will be posted. These will either be from landlords or from students. Some universities will also have online noticeboards where students can advertise to other students. Advertisements from students can be an excellent way to find accommodation. However, advertisements from landlords can be problematic. Word of mouth Some of the best housing in London is never advertised but is passed on from one group of students to another by word of mouth. It might be that you can find out about good offers from final year students. However, don't suppose that just because you have found out about housing from a friend it is necessarily going to be better than that found through any other source. Family Faced with the very high rents charged in London, some students and their parents will consider buying as an alternative. In some cases this might be a good choice. The information passed on by word of mouth is important because  _  ."

This was his first time to enjoy western music and this experience encouraged him to learn to play the piano. His talent at the keyboard has taken him from Shenyang to the world. Lang became a good piano student at three. Ever since, the boy has been doing better and better. In 1997, the 15-year-old boy studied at a famous American music college.

"Will you trust your friends if you can't see anything? If you are falling, do you believe they will catch you and help you stand up? Our teacher helped us to get the answer. One day, Mr. Morrie came into the classroom and said he had a game for us to try. He divided us into two groups. One student from the first group, stood in front of us with his eyes closed, and then fell backwards . The second group stood behind him. Before he fell on the floor, they should catch him and not let him get hurt. Most of us were uncomfortable with this. We were afraid that they wouldn't catch us and we would hit the floor. So we didn't move. We just stood there and laughed in embarrassment. Finally, one student, a thin, quiet, dark-haired girl called Sarah, decided to move. She crossed her arms in front of her body, closed her eyes, and slowly fell backwards. She looked quiet but brave. For a moment, I was sure that she was going to fall on the floor. But before she hit the floor, the other students caught her, held her and finally helped her stand up. ""Whoa!!"" We were all surprised, and also encouraged . The girl was happy, too. Seeing this, Morrie smiled and said to the girl, ""When you close your eyes, you can't see anything. You won't feel safe. When you are falling, the feeling gets stronger. You are not sure whether you will hit the cold, hard floor or the warm, soft hands of your friends. But if you are brave enough to trust them, they will not let you down ."" Why did the students feel encouraged?"

"The phone rings. It's a friend who wants to tell you his or her latest health problems. You hate to be impolite and cut your friend off, but what can you do? Stephanie Winston, author of Stephanie Winston's Best Organizing Tips, offers his advice: Don't ask questions like ""What's new?"" They give the information that you have time to talk. After ""hello"", get right to the heart of the matter. Time your calls wisely. If you make a call right before lunch or dinner, or at the end of the workday, people chat less. Set a time limit. Start with, ""Hi, I've only got a few minutes, but I wanted to talk to you about...."" Or, ""Gee, I'd love to talk more, but I only have a couple of minutes before I have to leave."" Jump on a pause. Even the most talkative caller has to pause now and then. Quickly say, ""It has been great talking with you."" Then end the conversation. Forget niceties. Some people just don't take a hint. Cut your caller off and say, ""I'd like to talk to you longer, but I'm afraid I have no enough time. Good bye."" Then hang up. Find ""a partner in crime"". If nothing else works, ask someone in your home to help you. For example, one woman gives a sign to her husband, who shouts, ""Jane, I think the roast chicken is burning."" Avoid the phone completely. Use an answering machine to screen calls. If you have an important message for a chatterbox, leave the message when he or she isn't in. What's the good time to make a call so that people can chat less?"

"An old man was going home late one night with his horse and cart after a day's hard work. When he was not far from his house, the light on the cart went out. He tried but could not mend   it. He was near his home, and so he went along the road without a light. When a policeman saw this, he stopped the old carter. ""Where is your light?"" asked the policeman. ""No man may take a cart along the road at night without a light. You know that. You have broken the law  ."" ""I had a light, but it has just gone out,"" said the old man. ""I don't believe that story,"" said the policeman. He took out a book and got ready to write. What's your name and where do you live?"" he asked. ""Please don't take my name,"" said the old man. ""My home is just there. You can see it from here. I had a light nearly the whole way. I haven't come far without a light."" ""You came all the way without a light. What's your name?"" The carter quickly took the policeman's hand and put it down on top of the light. The light was still hot and burnt the policeman's hand. The policeman jumped and he was very angry. ""Now, what do you think?"" said the carter. ""Did I come all the way without a light?"" The cart was stopped by the policeman because   _  ."

"Accurately forecasting the weather is a very hard thing to do. There are many parts of weather dynamics -- the study of how water and air in motion cause weather patterns -- to consider. Even the best forecast can be changed by a small weather disturbance halfway around the world. Today's forecast use complex computer models, weather instruments, and detailed analyses of daily observations to predict the weather. However, it hasn't always been that way. People, like your grandparents, use folklore and proverbs to help forecast the weather. They remembered what conditions caused changes and observed the factors associated with weather: atmospheric and cloud conditions, temperature, winds, and reactions of plants and animals. Many people believe that this way of forecasting weather is accurate more often than modem forecasting. Grandma's aching joints might indicate the arrival of a low-pressure system. She might also observe the geese flying lower than usual, confirming the low-pressure system. Finally, she might feel dampness on her skin, a sign of high humidity  . Based on these three observations, grandma might warn that a storm is brewing. Joints and nerves can indicate dropping air pressure, dissolved gases in the blood form bubbles under low air pressure. This causes pain in joints and nerve endings. Geese and other birds respond to changes in air pressure by adjusting how high they fly. In the fair, calm weather of a high-pressure system, the birds fly higher than in the stormy weather associated with a low-pressure system. Nature provides other clues to changing weather. A decrease in air pressure causes deer and elk to come down from the mountains to look for shelter. Some animals feed more than usual. The higher humidity before a storm causes some insects to leave the trees and gather near the ground. Some flowers close so rain doesn't get inside them. In winter, rhododendron plants curl up to protect themselves as the temperature drops. Several of the sayings apply in particular areas of the world. Here are some of them. #Early thunder, early spring. #Rainbow in the morning gives you fair warning. #When teeth and bones ache, expect the clouds to fill the lake. #When high clouds and low clouds do not match together, prepare for a blow and a change in the weather. It is a fact that the behavior of plants and animals is   _  ."
"Stop. Listen! What do you hear? You may hear many different sounds. Some of those sounds may be noise. Noise is a loud or unwanted sound. Noise can be caused by many kinds of machines, such as motorcycles, jet planes and farm tractors . Rock music is also noise. What happens to people who live near noisy machines or use them over a period of time? Doctors have found that these people have trouble in sleeping. But, most important, constant  loud noise can cause a loss of hearing. Scientists use a unit of measure called decibel  to measure the loudness of a sound. The sound of a quiet room, for example, measures 35 decibels. Talking measures between 40 and 65 decibels. Sounds from traffic and from some rock bands can measure over 120 decibels. Noise at this high level  causes the great hearing loss. We can conclude from the passage that  _  ."

About 500 people answered the survey question.

"Just as some people think that certain numbers are lucky or unlucky, others believe that we can use numbers to understand our personalities, or predict what will happen to us in the future. Numerology is a way of using numbers to describe a person's character, and to make predictions about future life events. Numerologists use the numbers 1-9, 11 and 22 -- also known as the ""master"" numbers -- to help a person understand his or her personality, life goals, and destiny. Numerologists consider yourLife Path number to be the most significant because this number describes your character. To find this number, add together all the numbers in your date of birth. For example, a person born on April 25, 1985 would add the month (4), to the numbers of the date (2+5), plus the numbers of the birth year (1+9+8+5). In this case the total is 34, so this person's life path number is 7(3+4). Numerologists believe that people with this number are peaceful and affectionate but can also be very reserved. Your Expression numberdescribes your talents and predicts how you should use these to fulfill your destiny in life. Numerologists assign a number between 1 and 9 to each of the letters in your name. These numbers are then added together in the same way as before to find your Expression number. Numerologists can also do calculations to predict when the most challenging periods of your life will be. Numerologists also believe that the day a person is born is important. Each day of the month has a character description. People born on the fourth are said to be responsible, honest, and stubborn. People born on the fifteenth have very strong attachments to family and home. Those who celebrate their birthday on the thirtieth are artistic, creative, and imaginative, and often make good writers. If we calculate the numerical value of our name and birth date, numerologists believe that we can learn more about our personalities. They also believe that we can predict our destinies, how our lives will progress, and what challenges we may face along the way. To the numerologist, numbers can be used in many more ways than we think. To understand your abilities and how to use them in your life, you should calculate your   _  ."
"THERE are natural disasters that humans can predict. There are others whose timing is difficult to know. What happened in Indonesia last month fell into the latter group. On October 25, a tsunami   caused by a 7.7 magnitude   earthquake in the Mentawai islands of West Sumatra, Indonesia hit shores and damaged whole villages. By last Friday, it had left about 450 dead and forced around 15,000 people to leave their homes. Tsunami is Japanese for ""harbor wave"". It is usually caused by a sudden rise or fall of part of the Earth's crust   under the ocean. It is most common in the Pacific and Indian oceans. Normally a tsunami is a series of waves. The waves can be very long - as much as 100 kilometers - and be as far as one hour apart. They are able to cross oceans without losing much energy. When the ocean is deep, tsunamis can travel unnoticed at speeds of up to 800 kilometers an hour. They can cross a whole ocean in a day or less. The wave may only be a few meters high but when they are near the shore and reach shallow water, they build up height very quickly. Some witnesses in the Mentawai islands reported seeing up to 6-meter high waves crash   onto the shore. Failed alert system Many countries set up early warning systems in their waters in the hope of giving people enough time to escape to higher ground in the event of a tsunami. But Indonesia's warning system, completed with German aid, stopped working about a month ago because of disrepair  , according to the country's Meteorology and Geophysics Agency. As a result, not a single siren   sounded after the earthquake. However, it was unclear if the sirens could have made a difference because the islands affected were so close to the epicenter   that the tsunami would have reached them within minutes. What do we know about Indonesia's Tsunami warning system from the article?"

It has books almost  on all subjects. It opens after school from Monday to Friday. Our school has uniforms . Boys wear white shirts and blue trousers. Girls wear white blouses and blue skirts. We all wear black shoes and white socks. We study English, Maths, History, Biology, Music and PE at school. My favourite subject is Biology. I think it is fun. Our teachers are nice to us.

"A young boy was sitting in the back seat of the car eating an apple. He asked his father, ""Why does my apple turn brown?"" his father answered, ""When the skin is removed, air reaches the flesh of the apple and causes oxidation. This changes the apple's molecular structure and results in a brownish color."" The boy asked, "" Daddy, what are you talking about?"" I know how that boy feels. Sometimes I want answers to some of those confusing questions that we all meet with, such as how to get through difficult times or what to do in a tough situation. I just want to get it right. The problem is that I don't always have the answer I need. Nobody else seems to have them, either. So I go on making mistakes and think that I'll never get it right. Often I didn't know what to do. I often made poor choices, but I gradually improved. Then I realized that I don't HAVE TO always get it right. I don't have to always know what to do all the time. All I really need to do is try my best, learn from my mistakes and go on. Dr. Leo Buscaglia once said, "" No one gets out of this world alive, so the time to live, learn, care, share, celebrate and love is now. That would be pretty hard to do when you're waiting for all the answers first."" So you got it wrong. You made a mistake. So what should you do next? Forgive yourself and try again.

"Coca-Cola is probably the most famous brand in the world, and in some areasyou can even access it easier than clean drinkable water. Although the company is trying to present itself as a health-conscious company, you can't really say that drinking cola is healthy for you. Still, we all drink cola, some more and some less, and we tell ourselves that it's all okay as long as we don't overdo it. However, Coca-Cola has other functions besides drinking. Cola removes the tarnish  from old pennies. Got some old rusty pennies? Not to worry! Put them inside a glass of cola and let them rest for a while. When you get them out, you'll have shiny pennies that will look as if they were coined a couple of days ago. If you couldn't clean those pennies with industrial acids, just buy a can of cola and let it do its magic! You can remove gum from your hair with cola. If you've got gum stuck in your hair and don't know a better way to get it out, don't worry, you won't have to cut it. Just pour some cola into a bowl and dip the part of your hair with gum on it inside. Leave it for a couple of minutes and then simply wipe off the gum. You can make an exploding fountain. You probably know about this one. You can make an exploding fountain by putting a mint  inside a two-liter bottle. Then move away from the bottle and get ready for a Coca-Cola explosion. This is a fun thing to do, but it is also a warning -- don't eat a mint and drink cola at the same time, because a similar thing could happen to your stomach. Why can't we eat a mint and drink cola at the same time?"
"In this day and age when we have a tendency to toss toys that are even slightly worn, it is tough to believe that there is a ""hospital"" where dolls can be repaired and brought back to their original glory. What is even more amazing is that such a place has existed for a century and is still going strong. Welcome to Sydney's ""original Doll Hospital"" that celebrated its l00th birthday, on February 22nd, 2013. In 1913, a general store owner in Sydney began importing dolls. However, the rubber bands  that held them together would often break. Luckily for him, his brother Harold Chapman Sr., was a good handyman and set aside a little ""hospital"" area in the store to repair the delicate toys. But when customers found out about this, they began bringing in their raggedy dolls, stuffed animals and even leather goods and umbrellas--starting what would become a family business for many generations. In l930, Chapman's son also, named Harold, relocated the doll hospital and expanded the business even further, by agreeing to repair anything that could be fixed, no matter how big or small. While business was _ , the real boom came in 1938 during World War Two. Faced with extreme restrictions, new dolls and toys became a rarity, and young girls and boys had no option, but to get their existing ones lovingly restored. While it does not have as many employees today, the hospital that is run by his son Geoff  Chapman now sits in a spiffy location with a beautiful store-front that features everything a little girl could possibly wish for, from new to lovingly restored, to even extremely rare and valuable  dolls. Also in keeping with modern times and dolls, the doctors are now specialists--some focus on bringing back to life modern dolls, while others stick to antiques. And then there are also the soft toy experts and accessory repair experts. Though it may not appear to be, the doctors say their jobs are very interesting given that no two dolls are the same or need the same repairs and that just like medical doctors they have no idea what obstacle they will have to face when they come to work each day. The one advantage? There are no emergency night calls to worry about! What can we learn about people working in the toy repairing hospital?"

"Spring is a good time for kite flying -- a popular activity in China. On a sunny day with a good breeze , you'll see hundreds of colorful kites flying in the sky. They have all kinds of shapes like swallows and peaches. Some of the shapes have special meanings. For example, swallows mean good luck and peaches bring you a long life. The city of Weifang in Shandong is the home of the kite. The city holds an international kite festival in April every year. There are competitions for kite-flying skills and new styles of kites. The most famous is the competition for the ""Kite King "". Thousands of kite fans from more than 30 countries visit the city to take part in the competitions, or to just enjoy this colorful event . The largest kite in the world is a big ""octopus  "". It's about 1,100 square meters, twice as big as a basketball court. Li Jingyang, a kite fanin Jilin, spent eight months making it in 2008. The kite was invented by Chinese people over 2,000 years ago. According to historical   record, kites were first used by soldiers to send news to their friends. In the Tang Dynasty, flying kites became a popular game played by everyone. As it was introduced to the West in the ll00s, the kite brought a great influence  on Western life. In 1782, the lightning rod   was invented with the help of a kite. Modern aircraft came from kites, too. At the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC, a board reads: ""The earliest man-made aircrafts were the kites and missiles   of ancient China."" Which of the following sentences is TRUE?"
"One is never too old to learn. Life learning (sometimes called un-schooling or self-directed learning) is one of those concepts that are almost easier to explain by saying what it isn't than what it is. And that's probably because our own schooled backgrounds have convinced us that learning happens only in a fine building on certain days, between certain hours, and managed by a specially trained professional. Within that schooling framestudy, no matter how hard teachers try and no matter how good their textbooks, many bright students get bored, many slower students struggle and give up or lose their self-respect, and most of them reach the end of the process unprepared to enter into society. They have memorized a certain body of knowledge long enough to rush back the information on tests, but they haven't really learnt much, at least of the official curriculum. Life learners, on the other hand, know that learning is not difficult, that people learn things quite easily if they're not compelled and forced, if they see a need to learn something, and if they are trusted and respected enough to learn it on their own timetable, at their own speed, in their own way--no matter what age and no matter whether we're at school or at home. Life learning is independent of time, location or the presence of teacher. It does not require mom or dad to teach, or kids to work in workbooks at the table from 9 to noon. Life learning is learner-driven. It involves living and learning--in and from the real world. It is about exploring, questioning, experimenting, making messes, taking risks without fear of making mistakes, being laughed at and trying again. Furthermore, life learning is about trusting kids to learn what they need to know and about helping them to learn and grow in their own ways. It is about providing positive experiences that enable children to understand the world and their culture and to interact with it. According to the author, the schooling framestudy often   _  ."
"The right name is important in the business world. All you have to do is think of the names for some of the products you buy every day and you'll agree that the name and the product are connected in everyone's mind.  In many countries, successful trade or brand names are protected by law. This is so that other companies cannot make a product that looks like another. People might think that they were buying one product and, in fact, be buying something different. Businesses register a company or a product name with the government. In fact, more than 1,000 product and company names are registered every hour. Many companies spend a lot of money to find the right name for their products. A good example of this is in the car industry. Some successful names for cars have powerful associations. The Ford Mustang and the Jaguar are only two examples of choosing the names of animals that are fast and strong.  When a U.S. company decides to sell its product in another country, it has to make sure that the product name translates properly. When Coca-Cola introduced its soft drink to China, it looked for the right name. It wanted a name that would do two things. One was to present its image in Chinese and the second was to be close to its first brand name -Coke. It took some efforts before finding the right word - which sounds similar and translates as ""happiness in the mouth"". Asian company names are not new to the United States. The brand names of Samsung and Sony have been successful. Finding the right brand name is a big business. Asian companies that sell to foreign markets pay to find a name that will connect with its customers. There are even naming companies that specialize in inventing product names. These companies can charge up to $ 100,000 a word for their creations. But it's worth it. Successful companies know how important the right brand names are for their development.

"There was a wonder-filled little girl who was hurt so badly that when she entered adult life, she thought she was so bad that others just couldn't be nice to her. But she had a lot of curiosity, which kept her going. She sought many wise people to help her understand why she was so bad that her mother hurt her and why she was unable to be better so that men wouldn't hurt her. She was on a journey that she thought was to help her be ""better"". She carried a big bag with her everywhere she went. Inside it were all the hurts she had experienced. Because she was so eager to please those who offered their wisdom, she willingly agreed with what they said about forgiving. But she held that bag of hurts tightly. After 50 years of carrying that bag around and showing it to all she met as if it were proof that she was a good person, she decided to open it up and just see what happened. When she looked inside it was filled with bits of paper. At one time they had words on them, detailing the hurts. But time had faded   the words and all that was left was some useless paper. She had been struggling to carry this bag that held nothing but the image of something that once was. She saw the absurdity of carrying that bag around. It made her laugh. By letting go of the paper and having pity for those that hurt her, this little girl was able to become a woman with beautiful hair. The woman looked in the mirror and said, ""I am lovable."" Although it took many years, she was finally open to bringing love and respect into her life. According to the passage, which of the following can be used to describe the woman?"
"Why do men die earlier than women? The latest research makes it known that the reason could be   that men's hearts go into rapid decline when they reach middle age.   The largest study of the effects of aging on the heart has found that women's  _ may be    linked to the fact that their hearts do not lose their pumping power with age.   ""We have found that the power of the male heart falls by 20-25 percent between 18 and 70 years of age,"" said the head of the study, David Goldspink of Liverpool John Moores University in the UK.   ""Within the heart there are millions of cells that enable it to beat. Between the age of 20 and 70, one-third of those cells die and are not replaced in men,"" said Goldspink. ""This is part of the aging   process.""   What surprises scientists is that the female heart sees very little loss of these cells. A healthy     70-year-old woman's heart could perform almost as well as a 20-year-old one's.   ""This gender difference might just explain why women live longer than men,"" said Goldspink. They studied more than 250 healthy men and women between the ages of 18 and 80, focusing on healthy  persons to remove the confusing influence of disease. ""The team has yet to find why aging takes a    greater loss on the male heart,"" said Goldspink.   The good news is that men can improve the health of their heart with regular exercise. Goldspink  stressed that women also need regular exercise to prevent their leg muscles becoming smaller and       weaker as they age. If you want to live longer, you should   _  ."
"American cities are similar to other cities around the world. In every country cities reflect the values of the culture. Cities contain the very best aspects of a society: opportunities for education employment and entertainment. They also contain the very worst parts of a society: violent crime racial conflict and poverty. American cities are changing just as American society is changing. After World War II city residents became wealthier more prosperous. They had more children. They needed more space. They move out of their apartments in the city to buy their own homes. They bought houses in the suburbs areas near a city where people live. These are areas without many offices or factories. During the 1950s the American ""dream"" was to have a house in the suburbs. Now things are changing. The children of the people who left the cities in 1950s are now adults. They unlike their parents want to live in the cities. Many young professionals doctors lawyers and executives are moving back into the city. Many are single; others are married but often without children. They prefer the city to the suburbs because their jobs are there; they are afraid of the fuel shortage; or they just enjoy the excitement and opportunities which the city offers. This population shift is bringing problems as well as benefits. Countless poor people must leave their apartments in the city because the owners want to sell the buildings or make apartments for sale instead of for rent. In the 1950s, many poor people did not have enough money to move to the suburbs; now many of these people do not have enough money to stay in the cities. Only a few years ago, people thought that the older American cities were dying. Some city residents now see a bright , new future .Others see only problems and conflicts. One thing is sure:many dying cities are alive again. What does the author think of cities all over the world ?"

It was the saddest moment of his life. ""The experts are telling me my body doesn't work! What am I supposed to do?"" he thought. To distract   himself, he picked up a book: Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers. The science-fiction describes a set of man-made muscles that would allow people to carry 2,000 pounds. He thought that if he could build something like that, it might be able to lift him out of his wheelchair. So he began his project and finally succeeded in building a set of robot legs. Several years later, he made an amazing recovery and was able to get up and walk away from his wheelchair. He even jumped out of an airplane again to celebrate. Reed wanted to do something for others with the second chance that life had given him. He has now perfected the robot legs that can get the injured, the elderly and the paralyzed   out of their wheelchairs. Now he has started his own company to make the legs. ""I've seen them compete in marathons and go swimming and mountain climbing,"" he said. ""So never give up!"" We can learn from the passage that Monty's goal is to   _  ."
"Have you ever had an embarrassing   experience? Last week we asked readers to tell us about embarrassing experiences. We received thousands of letters! Here is a selection. Tony: My most embarrassing experience happened when I had just left university. I had just started teaching in a Liverpool secondary school. One morning my alarm clock didn't ring. I woke up at half past eight and school began at nine. I quickly washed, dressed, jumped into my car and rushed to school. When I arrived, the students had already gone into class. I didn't go to the office, but went straight into class. After two or three minutes the students began laughing, and I couldn't understand why! Suddenly I looked down and understood. I had put on one black shoe and one brown shoe! Henry: The most embarrassing experience I've ever had happened two years ago. After seeing a film, my wife and I had lunch in our favorite restaurant in town. Then we decided to take a walk along the street. The street was very busy and we started holding hands. Suddenly my wife saw a dress in a shop window and stopped. I started looking at some watches in the next window. After a minute or two I reached for my wife's hand. There was a loud scream, and a woman slapped   my face. I hadn't taken my wife's hand!I'd taken the hand of a stranger! Henry was embarrassed because he   _  ."
"The first people who gave names to hurricanes were those who knew them best -- the people of Puerto Rico. The small island of Puerto Rico is in the West Indies, off the coast of Florida. This is where all the hurricanes begin that strike the east coast of the United States. Often they pass near Puerto Rico or cross it on their way north. The people of Puerto Rico expect some of these unwelcome visitors every year. Each one is named after the Saint's Day on which it arrives. Two of the most destructive storms were the Santo Ana in 1840 and the San Ciriaco in 1899. Giving girls' names to hurricanes is a fairly new idea. It all began with a story called ""Storm"", written by George Stewart in 1941. In it a weatherman amused himself by naming storms after girls he knew. He named one Maria. The story describes how she Maria grew and developed, and how she changed the lives of people when she struck the United States. Weathermen of the U.S. Army and Navy used the same system during World WarII. They were studying weather conditions over the Pacific Ocean. One of their duties was to warn American ships and planes when a storm was coming. Whenever they spotted one, they gave it a girl's name. The first one of the year was given a name beginning with [A]. The second one got a name beginning with [B]. They used all the letters from A to W, and still the storms kept coming. They had to use three lists from A to W to have enough names to go around. This was the first list of hurricane names that followed the alphabet. It served as a model for the system the Weather Bureau   introduced in 1942. Before 1950 the Weather Bureau had no special system for naming hurricanes. When a hurricane was born down in the West Indies, the Weather Bureau simply collected information about it. It reported how fast the storm was moving and where it would go next. Weather reports warned people in the path of the hurricane, so that they could do whatever was necessary to protect themselves. This system worked out fine as long as weather reports talked about only one hurricane at a time. But one week in September 1950 there were three hurricanes at the same time. The things began to get confused. Some people got the hurricanes mixed up and didn't know which was which. This convinced the Weather Bureau that it needed a code for naming the storms in order to avoid confusion in the future. Hurricanes were first named after the    _   ."
"An allergy is a strong reaction to a substance. Many things can cause allergies. The most common cause is pollen  , which is usually produced by trees in the spring, grasses in the summer and weeds in the fall, as part of their reproductive process. Other causes include organisms, chemicals, plants and dead skin particles from dogs and cats can also cause allergic reactions. So can insect stings and some food. The most common kind of allergic reactions is itchy   , watery eyes and a blocked or watery nose. Allergies can also cause red, itchy skin. Some reactions can be life-threatening, for example, when breathing passages become blocked. It is not always easy to avoid allergies. Drugs may offer an effective treatment. Another treatment used in some cases is called immunotherapy. A patient is injected with small amounts of the allergy-causing substance. The idea is that larger and larger amounts are given over time until the patient develops resistance in his body. In the United States, experts estimate that up to 8% of young children have food allergies. Every year these allergies cause about 30,000 cases with severe reactions that require immediate treatment. It can result in breathing trouble and in some cases death. It is said that about 100 to 200 people will die. It is said that most of the reactions are caused by peanuts and tree nuts like walnuts. People can also be allergic to medicines. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology says about 10% of bad reactions to commonly used medicines are allergic. In other words, a person's immune system overreacts and produces an allergic reaction. The most common reactions include skin rashes, itching, breathing problems and swelling in areas such as the face. Allergies seldom occur in winter because   _  ."
"It was another rainy day, it had stopped raining but the ground was still wet, with this remarkable smell of freshness, I was in the car with my friend, and ahead of us was a pitiful-looking old man, with a walking stick in his hand as it seemed he was having a hard time standing up or barely doing any effort. I have always had a weakness for old people; they break my heart, especially the ones begging on the streets, or selling flowers, I feel sad for them, having to be on the streets instead of being taken care of by their families or the government.               There was a car in front of us before we reach next to him. I had prepared money in my hand to give it to him, and I was looking at the car in front of us when the driver took a bill of money and threw it off the window--he threw it in the face of the old man and it fell on the ground, in a wet spot. The old man looked at the bill with a sad look, knowing it would take him an enormous effort to pick it up and he was hardly standing up, so I opened the car door, ran to him as he was bending to pick it up, took it, wiped it with my jeans since it was almost wet, gave it to him and gave him the money I had prepared for him.               The look on his face when he saw me doing that was the most rewarding look anyone has ever given me. He was shocked, and started thanking me for what I did and asking God to bless me, but I couldn't hear a word of what he was saying, I couldn't look him in the eye, how can someone so sweet like him with a kind and gentle look be left on the streets?               Helping him out surely made his day, but what he didn't know is that he affected me in a way he could never imagine--I still think about him very often, and I just hope everyone will look at old people the way I do. Which of the following statements is TRUE about the old man?"
"Study-abroad programs are a great way to learn about different cultures. Sometimes students don't have the money to join in these programs. That is why scholarships for study-abroad programs are starting to become popular.    Study-abroad programs can often be quite expensive. Finding scholarships is not that difficult. Usually, you can just visit the study-abroad office at your educational institution or even the financial services office. They will have a large directory  of available scholarships. If  your school does not have these offices, you can just quickly have a look on the Internet and find a wide variety of scholarships you might qualify for.    The credentials you need to be considered for a scholarship vary greatly. But, to be a candidate for any scholarship, you generally need to have good grades, be an outstanding person, and be able to take full advantage of the opportunities presented to you. You will be able to show why you are a good candidate through the application process.     The application process for each scholarship varies, which usually includes submitting  an academic record, an essay, and sometimes an interview. Usually, you will have to submit your academic records. The administrators of the scholarship will know that you take your academic studies seriously. Next you usually need to write an essay. This could be on a wide variety of subjects, but they usually focus on something related to 'why you should get this scholarship' to determine how much you want the scholarship and how good of a candidate you would be. After this, the final few applicants may be asked in for an interview to learn about you and why you would be a good recipient  of the scholarship. If you satisfy all these requirements, there is a good chance you will get a scholarship. If you don't have enough money, don't give up but use plenty of scholarship opportunities for you! To apply for a scholarship, the writer doesn't mention the credential that   _  ."
"Scott Langteau has this message for kids:spend less time playing video games. It's a message that many a mom and dad have tried to impress upon many a youngster (and some notsoyoungsters) who spend perhaps a bit too much time with game controllers in hand. But the 40yearold Langteau isn't a parent.He's a veteran   of the video game industry--one who played producer on three ""Medal of Honor"" games and cofounded his own game development company. Langteau has just published a children's books called Sofa Boy,which tells the story of a kid who spends too much time sitting on the couch with controller clutched in hand and the rather terrible consequences that follow. It's a fairy tale plucked straight from Langteau's own experiences as a lad with a fondness for video games and his own bouts with a bit of game addiction.But first,Langteau would like to make one thing clear,""I'm not saying that you shouldn't play video games.I think video games are great.I think they do great things for kids.""Instead,Langteau says his book is all about a little something called moderation  . ""It's about being well rounded,"" he says.""Just like with anything else,we all need to make sure that there's a variety in what we do."" Video gamers can be rather badtempered when it comes to accepting criticism about their favorite entertainment.And understandably so.After all,most people who go around talking about the dangers of playing video games tend to be outsiders--people who don't play video games and certainly don't understand that they can be a valuable and healthy form of entertainment. But Langteau and Sofa Boy seem to be in a  unique position to deliver a message of gaming moderation that the young game masses might actually listen to.After all,this is a man who understands what it means to be a kid with a passion for games.His early experience has taught him a lesson. By saying ""It's about being well rounded,..."" (in Para.6),Langteau means  _  ."
"Teachers' Day is, interestingly, not celebrated on the same day all over the world. In some countries it is marked by a holiday, in others it is a working day. International Teachers' Day is celebrated on October 5. Being held ever since 1994, it is in honor of teachers' organizations worldwide. Its aim is to encourage supports for teachers and to meet the needs of students. China--In 1939, Teachers' Day was set for August 27, Confucius' birthday. In1951, the celebration was stopped. However, it was founded again in 1985, and the day was changed to September 10. India--Teachers' Day is celebrated on September 5 in honour of Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the second president of India, whose birthday falls on that day. Russia--In Russia, Teachers' Day was celebrated on the first Sunday of October between 1965 and 1994. Since 1994, the day is _ on October 5, just the same day as World Teachers' Day. The US--In the US, Teachers' Day is non-official holiday. It is celebrated on the Tuesday of the first full week of May. A number of activities are organized in schools to honor teachers. The celebrations can continue for the whole week of May. Thailand--In Thailand, National Teachers' Day is celebrated every year on January 16. The first Teachers' Day was held in 1957.

"India is traditionally a tea-drinking country. But, it is now gaining a new taste for coffee. This has led international coffee companies to consider opening businesses in the huge market. Local business people are also hoping to profit from the country's tea-drinking habits. They want to open new stores that offer tea. It is ten thirty in the morning in India. Two cafes are within meters of each other, near a college in New Delhi. And they are selling a lot of tea. Their main customers are undergraduate students. ""We have a lot of break between classes, so whenever we get time, we just go and we enjoy ourselves. It's a lot of fun , especially when you are with people you enjoy spending time with."" In the past ten years , cafes have become increasingly popular in India. The country's huge young population have quickly taken to the coffee culture. Coffee stores have spread from major cities like New Delhi and Mumbai to smaller towns. Coffee use has doubled in the last ten years . It is the success of this market that has gained the attention of companies like the American-based coffee chain Starbucks. The company will open its first store in India later this year. Other companies like Lavazza and Costa Coffee are already there. Yet, the growth of coffee will not reduce the popularity of tea. Indians drink eight times more tea than coffee. They have been drinking tea for more than one hundred and fifty years. India is one of the world's biggest producers of tea, which is known locally as ""chai"". Outside homes and offices, it is mostly sold by small businesses on the street. Which statement is wrong according to the passage?"
"In recent months, a catchy song, A Little Apple, has become such a hit that it has even inspired square-dancing troupes  to mimic  its music video. When Old Boys: The Way of the Dragon, an adventure comedy featuring the song, was released on July 10, the unusual publicity strategy was applauded. Ticket sales of Old Boys: The Way of the Dragon surpassed 150 million yuan in the first week of hitting the big screen. Interactive online campaigns involving fans have become a popular way to promote a movie. The first two episodes  of Tiny Times, the directing debut  of author, Guo Jingming, made 800 million yuan at the box office last year, in spite of criticism for its portrayal  of lavish  lifestyles. Before the third episode was shown, fans donated a small sum of money online as ""investors"" in the movie. Some of the people who donated received film souvenirs, or the chance to visit the film set. Han Han, Guo's major competitor, has just released his directorial debut, road-trip comedy, The Continent. Han has over 38 million followers on Sina Weibo, China's major micro-blogging platform. He has broadcast the filming process of the movie to his followers since he began shooting. The film's trailer was released online in May, only three days after shooting and it has been viewed 4.7 million times. ""I don't care too much about the surprising numbers online, and what matters more is whether the movie is good or not,"" Han once said. However, when he invited popular singer, Pu Shu, to write the closing song for the movie, he must have had another idea in mind. Pu, who has been away from the public eye for some 11 years, also brings a new element for the movie claiming to be devoted to young people. The song became very popular as soon as it was released online. No one knows what other trump cards will be thrown on the table during the tense online campaign this summer. How does Guo promote his film Tiny Times?"
"She is a cute ,quiet girl. As a daughter, she has no secrets from her mother, who is very pleased with her. But these days she has become not so open as before. She has diary that she keeps under lock and key. Her mother cannot help  worrying about her: what if she falls in love, which is too early for her age. After all, she is reaching the ""dangerous time"". These thoughts have caused trouble in the mother's mind. One weekend the girl came to tell her mother that she was going to the cinema with her schoolmate and would return late. This was the first time her mother agreed, and she couldn't help worrying because her daughter had never been away at night before. The mother waited till nine. She decided to go out to meet her daughter. Just at that time the noise of a car pulling up drew her to the window and---there was her daughter, waving goodbye to a boy. Her heart missed a beat. When the girl came in, the mother was watching TV, just like nothing had happened. ""Mum, I'm back."" ""Yeah."" ""Sorry to be late. Still sitting up?"" ""Yes. Oh, that ... Who's that boy? "" The daughter fell silent for some time. ""Ah. It's my monitor . He gave me a lift on his way home. Mum, I'm going to bed."" ""All right. Go to sleep early."" The next morning when the mother went to the daughter's room to do some cleaning, she found her diary left on the bed. After a few minutes' thinking, she at last opened it to the page of the night before. It reads: Mum, It's love that made you ask, but it would show your understanding of me if you hadn't.

"(This selection was originally published in 1992. Pluto   is no longer classified as a planet.) Pluto is in many ways the strangest of the planets. It is small and has a large moon(called Charon). Its orbit  is unusual, which may cause it to have seasons in the sense that when it is close to the sun, the liquid  methane on its surface boils to form a kind of atmospheric haze . When the planet moves farther away from the sun, it starts to snow solid  methane. Pluto is not dark. Despite its great distance from the sun, the surface of Pluto is probably as bright as a moonlit night on Earth. The reason is all that methane, which is as white as newly fallen snow. The discovery of Pluto was more accident than design. The American astronomer Percival Lowell had predicted the existence of a ninth planet(he called it Planet X)based on what he took to be irregularities in the orbit of Neptune. Today astronomers argue that these ""irregularities"" weren't real, but the result of instrumental error. Nevertheless, Lowell produced predictions about where Planet X ought to be(although, to be honest, the predictions changed occasionally when he redid the calculations).In any case, in 1930 Clyde Tombaugh, doing a systemic sky survey that would have found the planet no matter where it was, discovered the planet we now call Pluto. By coincidence, its position was pretty close to where Lowell's last prediction said it should be. Was it just luck? We'll never know. What effect is produced by including the question ""Was it just luck?"" at the end of the text?"
"The Segway Human Transporter was invented by Dean Kamen.It is a two-wheeled vehicle designed for a single rider standing upright over its single axle  and navigate using a set of handlebars resembling those on a bicycle.Electrically powered, it could travel over 15 miles on a single charge and reach speeds up to twelve miles per hour.Its speed and direction can be controlled by riders' changing their weights. A college dropout and self-taught engineer, Kamen already held over 100 patents for his inventions when he developed the one he hoped would revolutionize short-distance travel.While still in college, Kamen started developing the medical devices   that made his name.Later, he changed focus to the challenges faced by wheelchair users.His robotic wheelchair known as IBOT could climb stairs.This robot ended up paving the way for the Segway. Before showing his most recent invention, Kamen had kept it a top secret for months.When it turned out to be little more than a motor scooter, many publicly expressed their disappointment.On closer examination, however, even his critics  had to admit that the vehicle was an engineering achievement.It answered the prayers of anyone who is worn out when walking downtown.Not everyone welcomed the Segway's arrival, though.Some complained it was too expensive, while others said it would further weaken the average American ' s fitness.A Japanese inventor even accused Kamen of stealing the idea for the Segway from him. Despite the controversy, the U.S.postal service began using Kamen's invention a month after its appearance, and a factory was built with plans to produce about 40,000 Segways every month.The argument is still on whether the Segway will be remembered as the greatest invention since the light bulb, or just another forgettable electronic device.Anyway, trips to the local supermarket will never be the same again. Which is not a feature of the Segway?"
"When McKenna Pope, 13, went shopping for a Christmas gift for her little brother, she planned to buy him an Easy-Bake Oven, a toy that allows kids to bake treats. Her brother, Gavyn Boscio, 4, loves to cook. But McKenna changed her mind when she discovered that Hasbro, the toy company that produces the popular oven, only makes the toy in purple and pink--and only features girls on the box and in commercials. So instead of buying an oven, McKenna cooked up another plan. She started a campaign to get Hasbro to make a gender-neutral oven. ""I don't want them to make a boys' Easy-Bake Oven and a girls' Easy-Bake Oven,"" McKenna, from Garfield, New Jersey, told the Associated Press. ""I want them to make an Easy-Bake Oven for kids.""    The Easy-only Bake Oven was first introduced in 1963. At the time, the stereotype was that only women cooked. Today, that's changed, in part thanks to famous male chefs like, Bobby Flay, who used an Easy-Bake Oven when he was a kid. Over the years, Hasbro says the company has featured boys on the packaging and offered the product in several different color1 schemes. But this year, just the purple and pink model is available. McKenna wants that to change, and she's not alone. Her petition , posted on change.org, has received more than 45,000 signatures.    By next summer, McKenna should have her wish. On December 17, Hasbro invited the New Jersey teen and her family to their headquarters in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, to meet with the Easy-Bake Oven team. They showed her a prototype, or model, of their newest Easy-Bake Oven, which is scheduled to hit stores in 2013. The new color1 scheme is black, silver and blue. The company also told McKenna they plan to feature boys in ads.    McKenna was happy with what she saw at Hasbro. ""They really met most or even all of what I wanted them to, and they really amazed me,"" McKenna said. She added that Gavyn thought the new design was ""awesome"". We know that when the Easy-Bake Oven was first introduced in 1963,   _  ."

"Moving can bring out the best and the worst in people, I'm finding. And I've discovered where a very generous spirit lives: Defiance, Ohio. After suffering through many months of unemployment, my wife and I had to move this week from Colorado to Ohio, where she would work as a sales assistant. Not knowing a person there, we were pretty concerned about all the work, including how we'd get all the things unloaded without killing ourselves. We decided to pay a couple of college students to help with all the heavy lifting once we got there. But one neighbor after another stopped by and joined in. ""What? Have we moved to some other country? Maybe we've died and gone to heaven!"" I thought. Unloading actually became fun as we connected with so many wonderful new friends as we worked. The more people that helped, the easier the work became. A job we were afraid might take days for the two of us alone was done in just a few hours. Many total strangers would either walk by or drive by to ask us if we were moving in. Many were delighted that this fine old house that had sat empty for so long was coming to life again. We were invited to an outdoor meal yesterday by neighbors on the same street. All the while, my brain was on this new sense of hope that people could be outgoing and kind to strangers. Among all the conversations were lots of offers to be of help to one another in a variety of ways. It's wonderful to live in such a kind little town. I feel so grateful to be here, and wish the rest of the world could see how an entire society can be a model for what it's like to look out for one another. I used to stay away from friendships with strangers, but now I live in Defiance! The neighbors did all of the following EXCEPT  _  ."
"Put technology in the hands of someone like Elon Musk and it can send people into space, make a future of clean and renewable energy a reality, or build electric cars. Put in your hands, and it can help you achieve all sorts of things, from learning to code to learning a language. Educational apps are becoming increasingly popular as a supplement , and sometimes as an alternative  , to traditional education. Why? Well, for starters, it's extremely convenient to learn on a pocket-sized device that you already carry around with you at all times. The best apps are also highly interactive and adaptive, _ . But apps, just like textbooks and language lessons, are a medium through which a language can be studied. The way you use them will affect how successful you are. If you flick through a textbook and don't dare say a word in your language lessons, you'll make slow progress. The keen reader who repeats each exercise in the textbook and engages the teacher in the conversation will move ahead. So how do you ensure you get the most out of your app, and what should you consider before you install  one? Before that, a very quick introduction: I developed the following five points from my experience as both a language teacher and learner, and from working in startups in the field of language. I spent six years teaching in Germany and Spain as well as developing a video learning startup. However, I first came to language learning late. I started learning Spanish at 22, and was able to use Spanish and German freely by about 28. I've been using language apps for the last few years, and participated in two successful one-week challenges to go from zero to hero in Italian and French. If you're interested, you can see the French challenge here. So, just before downloading an app, here's what you should think about... What does the author want to show by giving the example of how one uses a textbook?"
"I sat at my seat waiting for the school paper to be passed around. I waited anxiously, knowing that once I received it I would know how good a writer I really am. When the paper arrived at my classroom, I nearly knocked down five of my classmates to get to the first paper. With a school paper in my hands, I returned to my seat. About a month earlier, I had handed in one of, what I believed to be, my best stories. I named it Symbol of Success. The head of the English Department at my school, Professor Cullen had said that she would include some reviews of students' stories in the latest school paper. Professor Cullen was known for her rough criticism. Impressing her was very hard but I wanted to be the first to do so. I sat at the edge of my seat as I read through the other story reviews. There wasn't one story that got more than three stars .I became calm and wasn't anxious to know my review. It was long after that I heard someone shout out ""Five stars?! Seriously !"" from behind me. I turned around and saw the shocked expression of Gene's face, ""Peter, your story got five stars!"" I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I turned my attention back to my story and saw the five stars at the end of the review that I had not read yet. I looked through the review written by Professor Cullen. She wrote that I had a gift for story writing. I was proud that I achieved what I thought was impossible .For so long I believed I wasn't as good as I thought I was and that my talent was not enough to cover up my lack of wring skills .But this review proved that I was truly a good writer and that there was a future ahead of me in the field of fiction writing. The review and the five stars meant the world of me. Those five stars became the symbol of my success. What can we learn about Professor Cullen?"
"The united States has about 475,000 school buses -- all painted yellow. Each day they carry more than 25,000,000 children, half of all schoolchildren in the country. But these buses, on average, use four liters of diesel   fuel to travel less than sixteen kilometers. When the school year began last fall, diesel averaged 55 cents a liter nationally. The price nearly doubled, to a dollar and 8 cents, by the end of school in June. Bob Riley speaks for the American School Bus Council. He says fuel prices for schools are not much lower than others have to pay. As a result, schools are looking for ways to reduce transportation costs. Bus routes are being redrawn or, in some cases, canceled. Some areas are buying buses that use natural gas or other alternative fuels. Other steps include fewer field trips and less travel by sports teams. And some school districts may end any bus service not required by law. Studies show that school buses are the safest form of transportation to and from school. The American School Bus Council says cuts in bus service are bad for children and possibly the environment. It says removing buses from the road will mean an increase in other vehicles transporting students. Spokesman Bob Riley says another concern is that reducing bus services might reduce attendance. But it could also get more children to walk or bicycle to school. And that would surely make people happy at the National Center for Safe Routes to School. More kids walking or biking safely to school is the aim of a three-year-old federal program, part of an international movement. The goal is to increase physical activity and reduce air pollution. The United States will celebrate Walk to School Day on October eighth this year. But for some students, high fuel prices could make every day a walk-to-school day. The National Center for Safe Routes to School encourages more children to walk or bike to school in order to   _  ."
"""How call I obtain more drugs?"" I cried.""I can't live without the help of drugs!''.You see,I was only 14 years of age when someone said to me,""Here,smoke this! It will make you feel good."" So that is how my habit of d rug-taking began. Soon I felt I could not live without more and more drugs.So I found I needed more and more money to buy drugs.So I began to steal things from my family and from shops.Then in the street I pointed my gun at people,saying, ""Give me your money,or I will shoot you!"" I lost all my friends.My family also said,""Get out of this house and never return here!"" I then realized the truth-drugs were killing me.""Unless someone told me how to escape from the desire for drugs,I will soon be dead,"" I said .  Then one day,I read in a paper, ""We help drug-takers!'' I decided,""I will go and see what these people think they can do for me.""So I stayed at their meeting place for seven months.But they failed.They did not take the desire for drugs from me. Then one day,I read something in the magazine called ""La Paloma"".I read how people said,""We could not escape from the desire for drugs.But now we have freedom.God gave us power to escape this desire.God gives us the power of the spirit when we believe what Jesus Christ obtained for us by dying for us.""SO I decided,""I will go to this Betel meeting place as reported in 'La Paloma'.I will see if they can help me.'' Now I found these Betel people never left me alone.Yes,someone was always there with me day and night.Then one day I cried out to God,""God,please help me!"" I know God heard my cry.I found I now had power to escape the desire for drugs. At last I am free from the desire for drugs.I have found real peace of mind.I now enjoy life and help other people to overcome their d rug problem. The passage mainly tells us"
"Robert Kohout, 39, was working outside his home last October when he heard a frightening noise. He turned round and saw Walter Graham's car sinking into 8 feet of water of the inground swimming pool a little distance away from his yard. Kohout immediately called to Graham's wife, Evelyn, to phone 911. Then he ran back to his house to get Terence Reif and Glenn Fajardo to help, who were at work inside the house. ""There was no time for second thoughts,"" said Reif, a farmer's son. ""The only thing to do is to get in the pool."" The car doors were locked. Graham, 73, was unconscious, and his was rapidly filling with water. Reif struggled to break the driver's side window with a hammer but had trouble getting it done underwater. Finally, some four minutes after the car had fallen into the pool, the glass was broken. By then, Graham was floating at the top of the flooded passenger compartment. The three men pulled Graham out through the broken glass. He wasn't breathing and his heart stopped beating, so they performed mouth-to-mouth . The rescue team arrived in no time. Doctors supplied him with advanced life support on the way to the hospital. ""These people were getting to Graham through the glass,"" said Dr. Jeff. ""All three acted without regard for their own safety."" Added Evelyn Graham, ""they were truly angels, watching over us"". Which of the following would be the best title for this passage?"
"Weather changes when the temperature and the amount of water in the atmosphere change. We can see and feel water coming from the atmosphere when we have rain. But the water must somehow get back to the atmosphere. Meteorologists call this the water cycle. There are many stages in the water cycle. Rain falls when water vapour in clouds condenses . Drops of water form and fall to the ground. The water soaks into the ground and feeds streams and rivers. A lot of rain falls into the sea. The heat of the sun evaporates some of the water in the ground and in the rivers, lakes, and the sea. It changes the liquid water into water vapour. The vapour rises onto the air. Water vapour is normally invisible. On a very damp or humid day, however, you can sometimes see water vapour rising from a puddle  or pond in a mist  above the water. Water vapour also gets into the air from living things. Trees and other plants take in water through their roots and give off water vapour from their leaves. People and land animals drink water and breathe out water vapour. In all these ways the water returns to the air. There it gathers to form clouds and condenses to form rain. The rain falls to earth, and the cycle starts again. It continues even if snow or hail  fall instead because both eventually melt to form water. The amount of water vapour in the air depends on the temperature. The air is more moist  in the tropics  than in the cold polar regions. What is the main idea of the passage?"
"Almost every day we come across situations in which we have to make decisions one way or another. Choice, we are given to believe, is a right. But for a good many people in the world, in rich and poor countries, choice is a luxury, something wonderful but hard to get, not a right. And for those who think they are exercising their right to make choices, the whole system is merely an illusion, a false idea created by companies and advertisers hoping to sell their products. The endless choice gives birth to anxiety in people's life. Buying something as basic as a coffee pot is not exactly simple. Easy access to a wide range of everyday goods leads to a sense of powerlessness in many people, ending in the shopper giving up and walking away, or just buying an unsuitable item that is not really wanted. Recent studies in England have shown that many electrical goods bought in almost every family are not really needed. More difficult decision-making is then either avoided or trusted into the hands of the professionals, lifestyle instructors, or advisors. It is not just the availability of the goods that is the problem, but the speed with which new types of products come on the market. Advances in design and production help quicken the process. Products also need to have a short lifespan so that the public can be persuaded to replace them within a short time. The typical example is computers, which are almost out-of-date once they are bought. This indeed makes selection a problem. Gone are the days when one could just walk with ease into a shop and buy one thing: no choice, no anxiety. By using computers as an example, the author wants to prove   _  ."

"The way to teach the kids to take good care of pets The best way to teach your child how to be responsible pet caregivers is to be on yourself. This should start before you even get a pet--make sure you have realistic expectations about pet ownership. And take steps to select the right animal at the right time. As soon as you bring a pet in, set up and enforce rules regarding proper pet care. For example, tell your child not to pull the animal's tail, ears, or other body parts, and insist they never tease(,), hit, or chase  it. Teach the child how to properly pick up, hold, and pat the animal. These simple lessons are essential to helping the kid become a responsible caretaker. Although a certain pet-care activity must be handled by an adult, you can still include your child by explaining why and what you're doing. For example, when you take your pet to the veterinarian to be spayed or neutered, explain to your child how the operation not only reduces pet overpopulation but can also make it healthier, calmer, and more affectionate. Also involve your child in a pet-training activity, which not only make your pet a more well-mannered family member, but teach your child humane treatment and effective communication. Ultimately, your child will learn how to treat animals--and people--by watching how you treat the family pet. And they'll pay close attention to how you react when a pet scratches the furniture, barks excessively, or soils in the house. Frustrating as these problems are, ""getting rid of"" the pet isn't just unfair to the pet and your child, but it also sends the wrong message about commitment, trust, and responsibility. When faced with pet problems, get to the root of the problem. Often a veterinarian, animal shelter professional, or dog trainer can help you resolve pet issues so you can keep the whole family together. According to the passage, which of the following statements is TRUE?"
"A high school in Hiroshima City has been the first to do something with DNA in the world. Its students have won praise not only for doing this research but also for presenting their findings to groups of expert scientists. The school is one of the Super Science High Schools allowed by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology, where students are given an opportunity to study science at an advanced level. Here, students use the same type of hitech experimental laboratories as those found at universities. In these labs, they conduct experiments and research in new fields of study not found in textbooks. As part of this science course, the students, with the help of Hiroshima University, used a machine called sequencer  , and over the course of a year and a half they succeeded in decoding   the DNA. They then presented their results to academic groups. Achieving a world first might sound very wonderful, but the process of decoding the DNA involved very hard work. The students were also responsible for maintaining the equipment, and they had to read difficult research papers and put in extra study beyond their regular schoolwork. ""Researchers need to work hard. The work was tiring, but the students worked toward their ambitious goal of achieving a world first. They have a great sense of achievement, and the number of students who hope to become biologists has increased,"" said Taruma Akinori, who is in charge of the science course. In addition to the results being added to the scientific community, the students' research paper will be translated into English and made available overseas. Moreover, the students have decided to take on a new challenge in DNA decoding. The research paper will be put into English in order to   _  ."
"Do you want to have a friend whom you could tell everything to, like your deepest feelings and thoughts? Or are you afraid that your friend would laugh at you, or just can't understand what you are going through? Anne Frank chose the first kind. She lived in Amsterdam during World War II. Her family was Jewish   so they had to hide, or they would be caught by the German soldiers. She and her family hid away for two years before they were discovered. During this time the only true friend was her diary, which she called Kitty. In a diary dated on Thursday 15 June, 1944, she wrote, ""Dear Kitty, I wonder if it's because I haven't been able to be outdoors for so long that I've grown so mad about everything to do with nature. I can well remember that there was a time when a blue sky, the song of the birds, moonlight and flowers could never have kept me puzzled. That's changed since I was here for a year and a half.""

"New security camera can ""see"" through clothes New technology that can "" see "" through clothing and detect what ' s underneath can now be used to scan crowds, making it a potentially effective tool to prevent terrorist attacks in public places. The Thru Vision T5000 camera picks up Terahertz rays, or T-rays, which are naturally sent out by all objects and can pass through clothes or even walls. The camera can then detect metallic and nonmetallic objects hidden under clothing on still or moving objects without showing any body detail. While similar technology is seen at airports around the world, the T5000 is designed to be used in large, open areas. With a range of 25 meters, the T5000 can screen people in public places, thus avoiding bottle-necks at border crossing or security checkpoints. It also means people can be screened without knowing it. The technology develops from British astronomers' work in studying dying stars. Astronomers use T-ray cameras to see through dust and clouds in space. The company sees uses for its camera at other sites where political or business activities take place. For privacy concerns,Thru Vision Chief Executive Clive Beattie said the image produced by the camera did not show detailed parts of the body. "" It's almost a shining light bulb ."" Beattie said. ""You don' t see the detail that people might be concerned about. "" In London' s busy Piccadilly Circus--which is already filled with closed -circuit surveillance  cameras-- reaction to the new technology was mixed. Some said the camera was going too far and violating privacy,but others said they are willing to put safety before privacy concerns. "" There ' s surveillance everywhere anyway."" said one commuter. ""I don' t think it' s much of a difference. I don' t care that they can see through me because they can see me anyway."" Some experts said the privacy violation of the camera was not worth the benefit. "" What we should consider is how much we want to lose our privacy in order to obtain a sort of national security,"" said David Murakami Wood,director of the Surveillance Studies network,which deals with surveillance and privacy problems. "" In most cases this isn' t real security--it ' s a sense of safety that has very little real effect. "" What is the most probable purpose of the new invention?"
"China's top labor official said the country is planning to push back the age at which workers can retire. Yin Weimin, minister of human resources and social security, demonstrated that we did not put a timetable on the move when he spoke about it during a forum at the weekend. ""Delaying the retirement age is a very complicated issue and we will study it according to the situations of population and employment and consider different groups of people,"" Yin said. He noted that _ in the retirement age have been brought in by many countries and can be a good way to deal with an aging population and ensure the healthy and stable development of social security. The life expectancy of Chinese people is now 73 years and is expected to rise to 74 during the next five years, he said. Nearly three out of 10 Chinese people will be older than 60 by 2040, according to a United Nations forecast. The retirement age in China currently is 60 for men and 55 for female civil servants and 50 for female workers. The idea of delaying the retirement age is being widely supported by government officials, while many laborers and non-government employees were less enthusiastic about the prospect of working for longer. Currently, they have to pay into their pension plans for at least 15 years before they can retire. Chen Xianlian, a female worker at a motorcycle parts manufacturer in Chongqing municipality is among those who would like to see the retirement age left as it is. ""I have to do lots of tough and repetitive work every day and I feel very tired after my working day,"" the 41-year-old said. ""All my colleagues are discussing the government's possible move to lift the retirement age. None of us wants to work any extra years."" University graduates also fear that any rise in the retirement age could limit their employment opportunities. We can learn from the passage that   _  ."
"The Rugby   World Cup is currently being held in New Zealand. The tournament, due to finish on October 23, is living up to the famous English saying, ""Rugby is a thug's   game played by gentlemen. "" The games are physically aggressive; the tackles   on the pitch are brutal; but the end of each match is a civilized affair. Players shake hands and applaud each other. Of course, the other side to this saying is: ""Football is a gentleman's game played by thugs. "" Indeed, unlike soccer players, rugby players don't often question the referee's   decisions or pretend to be injured when they are not. ""Football could learn a lot from rugby,"" said Brian Moore, a former England rugby player ""The wonderful spirit of rugby is: there is a gentlemanly code to it. You play hard on the pitch, but you always respect your opponent.. Rugby is mainly played in Europe. Australia, New Zealand and parts of Africa. ""It is more enjoyable to play than soccer because you are always involved in the game,"" said Peter, a Welsh rugby coach. ""Rugby is also a far superior test of strength, stamina   and determination. "" Most professional rugby players are large, strong and weigh over 90 kilograms. People who play the sport need to be tough and be prepared to get hurt. Black eyes, broken bones, lost teeth and being knocked unconscious--all these are common injuries. Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown is blind in one eye thanks to a rugby accident at school. In England, children begin playing the game at school at the age of 8. When they enter high school, many begin to play full contact rugby. Children are taught to play for around one hour a week during their PE lessons. Most schools have a rugby team. Children who play for the school team are usually the sportiest kids, and are seen as brave and athletic. According to the passage, Peter thinks   _  ."
"Imagine what you could do with a machine that could make things disappear. For inspiration, you could read some books. In the books of J.R.R. Tolkein, Bilbo Baggins finds a ring that can make him disappear. Of course, there's also poor Harry Potter, who used his invisibility cloak   to hide from danger. Now that you've got some ideas, it's time for the hard part: building the cloak. To do that, you have to give up science fiction and turn to real science. An invisibility cloak has to cheat anything or anyone who might be watching. In order to understand how something can be seen, it's important to understand how we see. Human beings can only see objects that reflect   light waves. These waves enter the eye and are then processed by the brain. However, if an object doesn't reflect light, then the waves don't enter the eye, and the brain doesn't process. So building an invisibility cloak is building something that doesn't reflect light. Cummer was part of a team of scientists from Duke University, including David Smith and David Schurig, who built the world's first version   of an invisibility cloak. They had been inspired by the work of a British physicist, John Pendry. He in May said that an invisibility cloak was possible and Pendry was not the only one thinking about a disappearing act. At the same time, a Scottish physicist, UIf Leonhardt published a paper on building invisibility equipment. ""It wasn't easy,"" says Cummer. ""As often happens in science and research, it didn't work very well the first time. That first cloak didn't work like Harry Potter's --- the scientists didn't actually see anything disappear. So the research is still under way. "" What can be the best title for the text?"
"Steven Spielberg was not  a scholar, and his classmates teased him. Rather than read,  the kid really preferred running around with an 8mm camera, shooting homemade movies, which he showed to friends for a small fee. In his first year of high school, he dropped out. But  when his parents persuaded him to return, he was mistakenly placed in a learningdisabled class, which lasted one  month. Only when the family moved to another town did he  land up in a more suitable high school, where he eventually  graduated. After being denied entrance into a traditional filmmaking school, Steven Spielherg enrolled in English at California State University at Long Beach. Then in 1965, he  recalls, in one of those serendipitous moments, his life  took a complete turn. Visiting Universal Studios, he met  Chuck Silvers, an executive in the editorial department. Silvers liked the kid who made 8mm films and invited him  back sometime to visit. He appeared the next day. Spielberg, dressed in a dark  suit, carrying his father's briefcase with nothing inside but  a sandwich and candy bars walked confidently up to the  guard at the gate of Universal and gave him a casual wave.  The guard waved back. He was in. ""For the entire summer,"" Spielberg remembers, ""I  dressed in my suit and hung out with the directors and  writers, including Silvers, who knew the kid wasn't a studio employee, but winked at him. I even found an office  that wasn't being used, and became a squatter  . I bought some plastic tiles and put my  name  in  the  building  directory:  Steven  Spielberg,  Room 23C."" It paid off for everyone. Ten years later, the 28yearold Spielberg directed Jaws, which took in $470 million,   then the biggest grossing movie of all time. Dozens of films   and awards have followed because Steven Spielberg knew   what his teachers didn't--talent is in the eyes of the filmmaker. What can we learn from the story?"
"Ray Charles Robinson, a blind musician in America, was famous for his records of jazz, rock 'n' roll, blues and country music. But the world knew him better as Ray Charles. He had an influence on American popular music. The song Let's Go Get Stoned is an example of Ray Charles' own kind of music--his own sound. He worked hard for several years to create that sound. No one ever tried it before. He mixed black church music, blues and rock 'n' roll. The sound was extremely successful. In the nineteen fifties, his records began to sell millions of copies. At the same time, Ray Charles recorded jazz music. Those records sold well, too. People said they were new and exciting. Ray Charles became famous because he could play blues, rock and jazz. He also liked other kinds of music. He told the record company officials that he wanted to record an album   of country and western music. The president of the record company told him it would be a mistake. He said Ray's fans would not buy the album. Charles disagreed. He said he believed he would gain many new fans to replace the few he might lose. He produced the album and it was an immediate success. The album was called Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music. Many of the songs sold very well. One of the most popular songs was I Can't Stop Loving You. It is a countryandwestern song with Ray Charles' sound of blues and black church music. Ray Charles became popular with Americans because   _  ."
"The Horn of Plenty is one of the largest natural health food stores within the Greater Hamilton area. We are big supporters of buying locally and we are here to tell you why it is so important for your family, the community and the environment. The concept of buying locally is simple: buy food produced, grown, or raised as close to your home as possible. Not only will your food be fresher and tastier, but you are helping protect the environment and are supporting businesses within your community and reducing pollution. Better for the environment Sustainability   and global warming are such hot topics at the moment, and many people want to do their bit to help support a healthier environment. Small action carried out by many people can make a big difference. Most materials in an average North American meal have traveled about 1,500 miles to get from farm to plate. To cut out a big part of this travel would greatly reduce not only pollution from transportation and refrigeration but also customers' expenses as well. Taste and nutritional content Locally-grown fruits and vegetables are usually sold within 24 hours of being harvested. Because they are picked at the height of ripeness   and travel only a short distance to the market, their freshness, nutrition, and flavor are kept. Produce trucked in from far away may lose both taste and nutritional content. Community and home values When you buy direct from a farmer or buy locally-grown foods, you are engaged in a time-honored tradition between a grower and an eater. You also help keep dollars within your community. According to the author, when you buy locally-grown foods   _  ."
"A priest  had a cat that climbed up a tree in his backyard and then was afraid to come down. The tree was not strong enough to climb, so the priest decided that if he tied a rope to his car and drove away so that the tree bent  down, he could then reach up and get the kitty. He did so, checking his progress in the car again and again, then work out if he went just a little bit further, the tree would be bent enough for him to reach the kitty. But as he moved a little further forward, the rope broke. The tree went ""boing!"" and the kitty at once sailed through the air -- out of sight. The priest felt terrible. He walked all over the neighborhood asking people if they'd seen his kitty. Nobody had seen a lost kitty. So, he prayed, "" _ "" and went on about his business. Several days later he was at the grocery store, meeting one of his church members. He happened to look into her shopping cart and was amazed to see cat food. Before this woman was a cat hater and everyone knew it, so he asked her, ""Why are you buying cat food when you hate cats so much?"" She replied, ""You won't believe this,"" and told him how her little girl had been begging  her for a cat, but she kept refusing. Then a few days before, the child begged again, so the Mom finally told her little girl, ""Well, if  _ , you can keep it."" She told the priest, ""I watched my child go out in the yard, get on her knees, and ask God for a cat. You won't believe this, but I saw it with my own eyes. A cat suddenly came flying out of the blue sky, with its paws spread out, and landed right in front of her. "" The priest drove his car to bend the tree in order to   _  ."
"In cities with rent control, the city government sets the maximum rent that a landlord   can charge for an apartment. Supporters of rent control argue that it protects people who are living in apartment. Their rent cannot increase; therefore, they are not in danger of losing their homes. However, the critics say that after a long time, rent control may have negative effects. Landlords know that they cannot increase their profits. Therefore, they invest in other businesses where they can increase their profits. They do not invest in new buildings which would also be rent-controlled. As a result, new apartments are not built. Many people who need apartments cannot find any. According to the critics, the end result of rent control is a shortage of apartments in the city. Some experts argue that the minimum wage law can cause problems in the same way. The federal government sets the minimum that an employer must pay workers. The minimum helps people who generally look for unskilled, low-paying jobs. However, if the minimum is high, employers may hire fewer workers. They will replace workers with machinery. Therefore, other things being equal, the number of workers that employers want decreases. Thus, critics hold the opinion that an increase in the minimum wage may cause unemployment. Some poor people may find themselves without jobs instead of with jobs at the minimum wage. Supporters of the minimum wage say that it helps people keep their dignity. Because of the law, workers cannot sell their services for less than the minimum. Furthermore, employers cannot force workers to accept jobs at unfair wages. Economic theory predicts the results of economic decision, such as decisions about farm production, rent control, and the minimum wage. The predictions may be corrected only if ""other things are equal"". Economists do not agree on some of the predictions. They also do not agree on the value of different decisions. Some economists support a particular decision while others criticize it. Economists do agree, however, that there are no simple answers to economic questions. We can safely say that rent control  _  ."
"When the recent research was analyzed , it was found that a lot of people wanted free pictures or free music from the Web. If it couldn't be free, then they wanted it ""new"" or at least at a low price. It seems that 70 percent of people aged 16 to 24 download music online but only 1 in 40 tracks are bought legally. Thus, some companies are planning to give all of their music away for free. The music will be totally free except that you will have to pay with your time by watching advertisements. This will be perfect for those who have lots of time but little money. The Web has encouraged a belief that things can be free, or at least very cheap. It seems that everyone is looking for a good deal on the Web. The desire for free objects is part of the nature of the Web because the Web is about self-service and self-service is all about being free, cheap, fast and convenient. It's interesting how words change their meaning. Stealing has now become file sharing, but it's not really stealing, is it? Free is a funny word. We all know that very little is really for free. If we go searching on the Web for free music, we know--or should know--that there are risks involved. However, it doesn't matter. We still want free things, or at least the sense that we're getting a real bargain and that at a minimum we're saving time. What can be the worst experience on the Web? A site that charges us high prices and wastes our time. Which of the following can best describe the belief of the Web?"
"Many American women are earning money outside their homes today. Among women who are eighteen to sixty-four years old, more than fifty per cent have jobs.     In general, working women have had more education then those who stay at home. Of those who work, thirty-two per cent have attended college, compared with twenty per cent of those who do not have jobs.     Among women with jobs, eight out of ten drive a car to work, and eight per cent took a vacation a way from home during the past year. Much of their traveling was by air.     These figures come from a report which was written for advertisers. The report gives advertisers a new picture of women today. For instance, it tells advertisers that fifty-one per cent of all American women have traveled by air--along with fifty-nine per cent of all American men.     The lesson for American business is that many women now have other interests in addition to their homes. They like advertisements which show women in office, planes, and cars.

"What do you think the future will be like? Here are some answers from some students. Mary: If we don't take good care of the earth now, our children and grandchildren will be born into a world with much pollution . There will be fewer trees and more buildings, because there will be more people. Jack: I agree with Mary. Things will be worse . The weather in the future will be much hotter. Humans won't be able to live on the earth. They will have to look for another planet to live on. Linda: I think the life in the future will be better. Most people in the world will use ""green cars"" by 2020, so there will be less pollution and people will live to be 200 years old. As for space travel, I would say, we will visit Mars in about fifty years. What does Mary think life will be like in the future?"
"The Lunar New Year, which starts in late January this year, is the most important festival for Chinese people as most of them drop any business at hand to go back to their hometown to see their families. It is a tradition that has been cherished since ancient times, but as social mobility increases in modern times, the road to family reunions has become very uneasy. It is not the higher travel costs, nor the expected big spending on gifts and other festival items, but the train ticket that has driven many travelers mad. I've heard some colleagues complain that they have tried every means to secure a train ticket, only to find it a mission impossible. Some of them have turned to the latest software to aid online booking; others have sought help from friends to increase the possibility of successful booking. No doubt chunyun, the Spring Festival travel season, is the largest-scale annual human migration in the world. Last year, 220 million passengers traveled by train during the Spring Festival season, which usually lasts 40 days. It is a huge jump from 10 years ago, when the number was 128 million. With the big sudden increase in demand, the railway company has increased investment in railway construction; still, it cannot bridge the supply gap, leading to fierce public complaints and criticism. Admittedly, it is almost impossible for the railway company to suddenly improve its capacity to meet the explosive demand during the Spring Festival holiday. Moreover, any temporary increase in capacity would become unnecessary after the holiday and mean great commercial losses during the off season. What the company can reasonably do is gradually improve its capacity while focusing on better distribution of its existing resources during the special peak season. At any rate, however, the problem cannot be solved overnight. Compared with ten years ago, the percentage of passengers last year increased by  _  ."
"When I was a boy my father told me that he could do anything he wanted to.Dad said that he wanted to be the first to develop color prints in our city, and so he did. When I was 16,dad looked closely at the violin I played and said that he wanted to make one.He read about violinmaking,and then became a violinmaker at the age of 43.He bought the tools and materials,opened a small store and set Mom up as the shopkeeper,while he worked at a local company.He retired from the company 17 years later and continued to make violins and other instruments. Dad often guessed why the Stradivarius violins sounded so beautiful.Some experts told him that it was the special varnish that gave the instruments their beautiful sound.Dad argued that chemists could analyze the varnish--if that was the answer. One of Dad's friends asked him which kind of wood was used to make violins.When dad explained that the top was made of spruce ,his friend said that he had all old piece of spruce which dad might be interested in. He worked for the next 12 months making a violin from the wood that his friend had given him.It proved to be an excellent violin and it would become Dad's masterpiece.He believed that the secret of the Stradivarius sound was in the wood itself. Later, the instrument was stolen. _ But he kept the music shop until he was 80 years old,selling guitars and violins. The violin has been missing for more than 25 years.Somewhere a musician is playing a late-20th-century violin with an excellent tone.The owner today may never understand why this Ordinary-looking violin sounds so much like Stradivarius. What could be the best title of the passage?"
"No one could have failed to be moved had he watched the live televised volleyball game between the Chinese and Cuban women's teams. As we sat before the television set, with our eyes fixed on the screen, we experienced every kind of feeling. When the two teams played neck and neck, we were on pins and needles, anxious as to what would come next, and when our team fell behind our hearts were in our mouths. Watching the game between those two teams is not only a matter of great joy. For more than that it provides food for thought. Just see how the Chinese women won the game --by their co --operation  , by their excellent skill, their effort and strong will. A Chinese saying goes, ""When two competent opponents   meet, the strong --minded one will win. ""This is the spirit of the Chinese Women's Volleyball Team. If every Chinese showed some of the spirit, never losing heart in times of difficulty and remaining clear --minded in times of advantage  , then our nation would stand in the vanguard   of the world family of nations, just as the Chinese Women's Volleyball Team has done, is doing and will do.

"The huge thirst for jobs in the civil service has made the national civil servant  exam one of China's most competitive tests. The first exam was held in 1995, and since then more and more people have signed up for it, with applications reaching a peak over the last two years. The latest online survey, carried out by China Youth Daily and www.qq.com, found that more than 73 percent of young people want to work as civil servants. Of the 17,330 respondents, about 83 percent said they were attracted by the job's stability, guaranteed health care and pension . Meanwhile, 55 percent said it could bring ""practical profits"". Nearly 1 million people applied to take the exam last year, yet only just over 10,000 were finally employed. This year the competition continued. The exact number of applicants is not known, with the final day for applications today. But the flood of applicants has already broken the exam's website once. China Youth Daily reported that the site was forced to close for  _ due to unusually high traffic on the night of October 16, which has never happened in the past. In a typical year several hundred applicants will apply for many of the jobs listed. For example, the five job vacancies provided by the secretariat   of the Central Committee of the CPC have attracted more than 3,880 applicants this year. Positions as civil servants are attractive, not only because of the stable income and good health care, but also because of the low risks compared with the power and resources the positions enjoy. Among the total 6 million public servants, around 20,000 were dismissed between 1996 and 2007. How many people on average will compete for one post provided by the secretariat of the Central Committee of the CPC this year?"
"MELBOURNE, Australia - A kangaroo frightened by a man walking his dog attacked the pair, throwing the pet underwater and hitting the owner in the stomach with its back legs. The Australian, Chris Rickard, was in stable condition Monday after the attack, which ended when the 49-year-old struck the kangaroo in the throat. Rickard said he was walking his blue dog, Rocky, on Sunday morning when they surprised a sleeping kangaroo in Arthur's Creek northeast of Melbourne. The dog chased the animal into a pond, when the kangaroo turned and knocked the pet underwater. When Rickard tried to pull his dog free, the kangaroo turned on him, attacking with its back legs and tearing a deep cut into his stomach and across his face. ""I thought I might take action to drag the dog out from under his grasp, but I didn't expect him to actually attack me,"" Rickard, 49, told The Herald Sun newspaper. ""It was a shock at the start because it was a kangaroo, about 5 feet high, they don't go around killing people."" ""I was stuck having to hold on to the dog with both hands because it was half drowned and I couldn't really see anything because the kangaroo just attacked me."" He added, ""All I could do was just keep pushing for the bank and he was trying to push me under the water, so at that point I struck him in the throat and that made him back off a little bit. ""I don't think I'll ever be able to watch kangaroo programs quite the same as I used to -- it might bring back a couple of bad memories."" Kangaroos rarely attack people but will fight if they feel threatened. Dogs often chase kangaroos, which have been known to lead the pets into water and defend themselves there. Rickard said he ended the attack by hitting the kangaroo in the throat adding Rocky was ""half-drowned"" when he pulled him from the water. As a result of the attack,   _  ."
"The environmental group 350.org has launched a new campaign called Climate Name Change that proposes to revise to how hurricanes are named: call them after policymakers who say that humans are not to blame for global warming. This will save the Katrinas and Sandys of the world from the injustice of having their names attached to major disaster, the group says. And, as a bonus, it will produce some peculiar weather reports. ""Rick Perry leaves trail of death,"" appears under a broadcast titled ""Rick Perry: The Tragedy."" ""Michelle Bachman is incredibly dangerous. If you value your life, please seek shelter from Michelle Bachman,"" says an official while addressing a news conference. The campaign is unlikely to influence the World Meteorological Organization, which has since 1954 named Atlantic tropical storms from an official list. But the campaign's goal seems less to actually name a hurricane after the speaker of the house, and more to call attention to an issue that this month has reached an alarming level of seriousness. The campaign comes just a month before the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will release its most recent report on the state of global warming and a week after a draft of the report was given away to Reuters. In the draft, scientists concluded with near certainty - about 95 percent sure - that humans are to blame for the worldwide temperature hikes over the last few decades. That was a revision from the 2007 report, which put scientific certainty that human activities were driving global climate change at about 90 percent. And global warming, the report said, is not slowing down - it, actually, is accelerating. That means that sea levels could balloon upward as much as three feet by the end of the century, if emissions  continue at their current pace. Still, as the Washington Post Climate notes, hurricanes are not the best sign of global warming. Though current data suggests that global warming will in the future stir up terrible super storms, there is still not enough evidence to support the idea that climate change strengthens the recent hurricanes that have torn at the US's eastern coastline. The draft of the global warming report tells us that   _  ."
"Telepathy: Mind-to-mind Contact Telepathy is the ability to communicate without the use of the five senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste). It's an instinct   which can be woken up in times of emergency or need. When we feel that something is happening or about to happen by instinct, we're using resources within the unconscious mind. When the resources of two persons' unconscious minds link together into the same frequency, we call it Telepathy. We can either send or receive Telepathy. If you know who is calling before you answer the ringing phone, you are probably a good receiver. If you think of a person and he/she calls you, you are most likely to be better at sending. You can easily put your abilities to the test. Think of somebody and will him or her to contact you. Be patient. The other person may not be a good receiver, but they should contact you much earlier than would normally be expected. Or whenever the phones rings, but try ""feeling"" who is contacting you. Don't guess, but try to feel it with your mind. However, if neither of these work for you, that doesn't mean that you have no ability of telepathy. As mentioned earlier, telepathy is most likely to turn up in case of emergency. Telepathy dreams often contain telepathic messages. Two people may both dream of the other and find that their dreams had a clear connection. These people are probably linking to each other's unconscious mind. Telepathy & Relationships. The more people spend time together, the more likely they are to be able to link up to the other's mind, especially when separated. There are two reasons for this. One is that they understand the other's mind through time spent together; the other is that there is usually a strong desire to communicate. A mother will often sense that her child is in danger. This is due to the child's eagerly wanting his or her mother, knowing that this person who would always want to be there for them, and the mother's deep desire to protect her child from harm. Which is not the way to help people gain Telepathy?"
"In 1932 the warning of the British politician, Stanley Baldwin, that ""the bomber will always get through"" made a deep impression in Britain, the only state to make serious plans to evacuate civilians from large towns before the war started. The British Government developed plans for evacuating 1 million children to the United States and Canada and other Commonwealth nations. It established the Children's Overseas Reception Board (CORB) in May 1940. After the fall of France, many people thought the war was lost and some saw this as one way of ensuring that Britain could survive even if invaded. The Germans eventually began bombing British cities in September. Some children were evacuated by ship to British Dominions, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa. The CORB selections were not done on a first-come, first-served basis. CORB classified and prioritized the children. Charges soon appeared in the press that the well-to-do were being given priority. CORB arranged for the transportation. The Government paid the passages. Quite a number of children had already been evacuated. This tended to be children from rich families with money and overseas contacts. The British public eventually demanded the government pay so that less privileged children were also _ . World War II occurred before the beginning of trans-Atlantic air travel. Liners were used to transport the children and this proved to be dangerous because the U-boats quickly emerged as the greatest threat. And this put the evacuee children trying to cross the Atlantic to safety in danger. Two ships carrying child evacuees were torpedoed  in 1940. One was the Dutch liner Volendam with 320 children on August 30. The crew managed to get the life boats off and saved the children. They were returned to Glasgow. The other was the City of Benares, an ocean liner with 200 British and foreign civilian passengers and 93 British children with a guard of nurses, teachers, and a clergyman. It was torpedoed on September 13. The crew attempted to launch the life boats as Benares began to sink. The rough weather made this difficult, so many of the passengers in the life boats died in the extreme conditions. Only 15 children survived. Churchill, when he learned of the disaster, decided to end the overseas evacuation scheme. Churchill decided to end the evacuation scheme mainly because   _  ."
"Japanese people work very hard at studying English. They start studying English at the age of 12. Most young Japanese people spend a lot of time and work hard at studying English, but Japanese people are not good at English. Here are the reasons: There are few people from English-speaking countries in Japan. They don't have enough chances to speak with them. Japan is an island country and they feel that other countries are far away. So they don't use English very often. And the Japanese feel that it is strange  to talk to each other in English. The Japanese education doesn't always follow the educational trends  in the world. It puts a lot of importance on grammar and vocabulary, and less on speaking, listening and reading skills. Many Japanese students' English becomes worse  after they go to university .They have to learn English again if they work in English-speaking countries. Sometimes the Japanese feel shy about speaking wrong or broken English. How is the university students' English in Japan?"
"About the year 1900, a dark-haired boy named Charlie Chaplin was often seen waiting outside the back entrances of London theatres. He looked thin and hurry. He was hoping to get work in show business. He could sing and dance, and above all, he knew how to make people laugh. But he couldn't get work and therefore wandered about the city streets. Sometimes he was sent away to a home for children who had no parents. But twenty years later, this same Chaplin became the greatest, best-known, and best-loved comedian   in the world. Any regular visitor to the cinema, must have seen some of Charlie Chaplin's films. People everywhere have sat and laughed at them until the tears ran down their faces. Even people who don't understand English can enjoy his films, because they are mostly silent. It isn't what he says that makes us laugh. His comedy doesn't depend upon   words or language. It depends upon little actions which mean the thing to people all over the word. Acting out without words, of common human situations plays an important part in the dances and plays in many countries. It's a kind of the world language. Chaplin lived most of his life in America and died in Switzerland on Christmas Day 1977, at the age of eighty-eight. There was sadness all over the world at the news of his death. Twenty years later, Chaplin became the best   _  ."

"Thirty years ago, Lake Ponkapog in Hartwell, New Jersey, was full of life. Many birds and animals lived beside the water, which was full of fish. Now there are few birds, animals, and fish. The lake water is polluted. It is in a colour of dirty brown, and it is filled with strange plants. How did this happen? First, we must think about how water gets into Lake Ponkapog. When it rains, water comes into the lake from all around. In the past, there were forests all round Lake Ponkapog, so the rainwater was clean. Now there are many homes around the lake. People often use the chemicals  in their gardens. They use other chemicals inside their houses for cleaning and killing insects. There are also many businesses. Businesses use chemicals in their machines of shops. Other chemicals fall onto the ground from cars or trucks. When it rains, the rainwater picks up all the chemicals from home and businesses and then carries them into the lake . They pollute the water and kill the animals. Boats on the lake are also a problem. Lake Ponkapog is a popular place for motorboats . But oil and gas from boats often get into the lake. So more bad chemicals go into the water this way. People in Hartwell are worried . They love their lake and want to save it. Will it be possible? A clean lake must have clean rainwater going into it. Clean rainwater is possible only if people are more careful about chemicals at home and at other chemicals on the ground. And they mustn't use motorboats any more on the lake. All these may change people's lives. Only then can Lake Ponkapog be a beautiful, clean lake again. Cleaner rainwater will mean   _   ."
"Does handwriting matter? Not very much, according to many educators. However, scientists say it is far too soon to declare handwriting is not important. New evidence suggests that the link between handwriting and educational development is deep. Children not only learn to read more quickly when they first learn to write by hand, but they are also better able to create ideas and remember information. In other words, it's not only what we write that matters -- but how. A study led by Karin James, a psychologist at Indiana University, gave support to _ . A group of children, who had not learned to read and write, were offered a letter or a shape on a card and asked to copy it in one of three ways: draw the image on a page but with a dotted outline , draw it on a piece of blank white paper, or type it on a computer. Then the researchers put the children in a brain scanner and showed them the image again. It was found that when children had drawn a letter freehand without a dotted outline or a computer, the activity in three areas of the brain were increased. These three areas work actively in adults when they read and write. By contrast, children who chose the other two ways showed no such effect. Dr. James attributes the differences to the process of free handwriting: Not only must we first plan and take action in a way but we are also likely to produce a result that is variable. Those are not necessary when we have an outline. It's time for educators to change their mind and pay more attention to children's handwriting. Which is NOT the children's task in the experiment?"
"Six volunteers are about to find out what it would be like to live on Mars without ever leaving the Earth. Three men and three women will spend eight months living in a special place on the side of a volcano in Hawaii. They are part of an experiment that is designed to mimic life on Mars. Their mission began on October 15, 2014. NASA says it could send astronauts to Mars as early as the 2030s. The mission would take more than two years, so NASA needs to know how people would react to living in a small group, isolated from the rest of the world, for such a long time. Some people may become depressed or bored living under those conditions. By studying people living in similar conditions here on Eares NASA hopes to learn how to choose the most suitable people for a space mission, and how to help them get along. They will live in a two-story building. The ground floor is about 86 square meters, roughly the size of a small two-bedroom apartment. It includes shared areas like kitchen, dining room, bathroom, laboratory and an exercise room. The upstairs is less than half the size of the downstairs. It contains another bathroom and six small bedrooms. The building is located in an abandoned quarry about 2,400 meters up the side of Mauna Loa, the second biggest volcano in the world. It is constantly monitored for signs of volcanic activity. NASA chose the location because the appearance looks very similar to Mars. To make it more like being on Mars in the future, they are only able to communicate by email during the experiment. Meanwhile, there will be a 20-minute delay between the time when a message is sent and that when it is received. When they go outside, they will have to suit up in full spacesuits, just as if they were on Mars. The commander is Martha Lenio, a 34-year-old Canadian. During the mission, she will run experiments on growing food. The other members have backgrounds in physics and so on. None of them are astronauts. What's the main purpose of the experiment?"
"American beekeeping operations have been hit hard by what scientists call colony collapse disorder(C.C.D.). Almost half of their worker bees have disappeared during the past season. C.C.D. has also been reported in Israel, Europe and South America. Bees fly away from the hive and never return. Sometimes they are found dead; other times they are never found. Many crops and trees depend on pollination   by bees to help them grow. A new report says virus may be at least partly responsible for the disorder in honey bee colonies in the United States. This virus is called Israeli acute paralysis virus. It was first identified in Israel in 2004. Ian Lipkin at Columbia University in New York and a team reported the new findings in Science magazine. Doctor Lipkin says the virus may not be the only cause. He says it may work with other causes to produce the collapse disorder. The team found the virus in colonies with the help of a map of honey bee genes that was published last year. They examined thirty colonies affected by the disorder. They found evidence of the virus in twenty-five of them, and in one healthy colony. The next step is further testing of healthy hives. The researchers suggested that the United States may have imported the disorder in bees from Australia. They say the bees may carry the virus but not be affected. The idea is that unlike many American bees, the ability of Australian bees to fight disease has not been hurt by the varroa mite . This insect attacks honey bees, which could make the disorder more likely to affect a hive. Australian bee producers reject these suspicions. And some researchers suspect that bee production in the United States is down mainly because of the weather. Honey bees gather nectar  from flowers and trees. The sweet liquid gives them food and material to make honey. But cold weather this spring in the Midwest reduced the flow of nectar in many flowers. Many bees may have starved. Dry weather in areas of the country could also be playing a part. Wayne Esaias is a NASA space agency scientist who keeps bees in his free time. He lives in central Maryland, where he has found that flowers are blooming a month earlier than they did in 1970, which may be partly responsible for the disorder. Wayne Esaias is organizing a group of beekeepers to document nectar flow around the country. How many possibilities may be involved in the bee disorder according to the passage?"
"There is an old Chinese tale about a woman whose only son died. Sadly, she went to the holy man and asked, ""What magical things do you have to bring my son back to life?"" Instead of sending her away or reasoning with her, he said to her, ""Fetch me a mustard   seed from a home that has never known sadness. We will use it to drive the sadness out of your life."" The woman happily went off at once in search of that magical mustard seed. She first came to a splendid house, knocked at the door and said, ""I am looking for a home that has never known sadness. Is it such a place? It is very important to me."" They told her ""You've certainly come to the wrong place"" and began to describe all the tragic things that had happened to them recently. The woman said to herself, ""I have had misfortune of my own. Who is able to help these poor, unfortunate people?"" She stayed to comfort them, and then went on in search of a home that had never known sadness. But wherever she went, she found one tale after another of sadness and misfortune. She became so involved in other people's sorrow that finally she forgot about her search for the magical mustard seed, never realizing that it had, in fact, driven the sadness out of her life.

"Computer games are more and more popular with teenagers. Games are fun. After hours of homework it's great to relax by playing a game. But do games ever do kidsany harm?

One problem found that parents are not taking enough notice of their kids'games -playinghabits. Many games sells output controls   on the games to help parents make sure that children don't play things unsuitable for them, said David Walsh, president of the national Institute on media and the Family. Parents need to watch the games kids are playing and how much time they are spending playing them. The study found that playing games too long can affect kids' health as well as their schoolwork. Almost half of all "" heavy games"" are six to 17 years old. These kids are more likely to have weight and eyesight problems than other kids.

I've danced with her since I was six. She's been through so many difficulties and came through them all. I've learned to get over bad life's experiences and learned how to move on because of her.""

"Are you carrying too much on your back at school? You're not alone. Back experts in the USA were worried that young students are having back and neck problems because they are carrying too much in their backpacks (schoolbags). ""It hurts my back when I run,"" said Eglin Reyes, a student in Virginia. ""It's hard to get up the stairs with my backpack because it's too heavy."" Students have to carry heavy backpacks on their backs for a whole week's study. Beeline is one of them. They have regular backpacks with two straps  to carry them, but a number of students with heavy loads have switched to rolling backpacks. The backpacks have wheels and can roll on the ground. Shirley Park's backpack weighs 10 kilos, and she said, ""I'll change to a rolling backpack because I am starting to have back pain."" How much is too much? Experts say that students should carry no more than 10 to 15 percent of their own body weight. A few students have had a good idea to lighten the load: Less homework. Doctor's suggestions: *Lighten the load. Take home only the books the students need that night. *Wide straps are better. They can send out weight over your shoulders and be sure to wear backpacks with two straps. *The heaviest things should be packed closest to the back. *Bend  both knees when you pick up the pack, don't just bend the waist .

"You hear this,""No wonder you are fat.All you ever d0 is eat.""You feel sad.""I skip my breakfast and supper.I run every morning and evening.What else can I do?"" Basically you can do nothing.Your genes,not your life habits,determine your weight and your body constantly tries to maintain it. Albert Stunkard of the University of Pennsylvania found from experiments that""80 percent of the children of two fat parents become fat,as compared with no more than 14.percent of the children of two parents of normal weight."" How can obese people become thinner through dieting? Well,dieting can be effective.but the health costs are great. Jules Hirsch,a research physician at Rockefeller University,did a study of eight fat people.They were.given a liquid formula providing 600 calories a day.After more than 10 weeks,the subjects lost on average 45 kg.But after leaving the hospital,they all regained the weight. The results were surprising:by metabolic measurement,fat people who lost large amounts of weight seemed like they were starving.They had psychiatric problems.They dreamed of food or of breaking their diet They were anxious and depressed.Some wanted to kill themselves.They hid food in their rooms. Researchers warn that it is possible that weight reduction doesn't result in normal weight,but in an abnormal state lust like that of starved non.obese people. Thin people, however,suffer from the opposite.They have to make a great effort to gain weight  Ethan Sims of the University of Vermont got prisoners to volunteer to gain weight.In four to six months--they ate as much as they could.They succeeded in increasing their weight by 20 to 25 percent. But months after the study ended,they were back to normal weight and stayed there. This did not mean that people are completely without hope in controlling their weight.It means that those who tend to be fat will have to constantly battle their genetic inheritance if they want to significantly 1ower their weight. The findings also provide evidence for something scientists thought was true--each person has a comfortable weight range.The range might be as much as 9kg.Someone might weigh 60--69kg without too much effort.But,going above or below the natural weight range is difficult.The body resists by feeling hungry or full and changing.the metabolism to push the weight back to the range it seeks.

At work or at play, you'll find yourself in groups, working with other people: your team at work, a meeting with fellow workers, your family, a holiday with friends, a group of students working together, a group of neighbors wanting to make changes. It is now realized that being able to work successfully with other people is one of the main keys to success, partly because we need to do it so often. In almost every situation where you're in a group, you will need a skilled leader. All groups need leaders and all successful groups have good leaders. Groups without leaders or with weak leaders almost always break down. Members of a leaderless group often begin to feel disappointed and helpless. Time is wasted and the tasks are not achieved. There are often arguments and nervousness between people as there is nobody to keep the goals clear. Some people are natural leaders. The well-known cook, Antonio Carlucci says, ""True leaders are born and you see them in kitchens."" They're people who are strong, fair, and humorous. Although a lot of people agree that there are some natural-born leaders, most people now know that leadership can also be taught. Experienced teachers can train almost anyone how to be a successful leader. Good leaders don't make people do things in a controlling way. You can learn how to join others, encouraging the whole group to work towards a common goal. Successful leaders also need to be calm and wise. They need to be able to work out good solutions and make perfect judgments* under pressure. Lastly, and probably most importantly, good leaders need to be sensitive*, confident and be able to get on well with different kinds of people. Which of the following is NOT correct according to this passage?"
"I grew up in the south of Spain in a little community called Estepona. I was 16 when one morning, my father told me I could drive him into a remote village called Mijas, about 18 miles away, on the condition that I take the car in to be serviced(,) at a nearby garage. Having just learned to drive and hardly ever having the opportunity to use the car, I readily accepted. I drove Dad into Mijas and promised to pick him up at 4 p.m., then drove to a nearby garage and dropped off the car. Because I had a few hours to spare, I decided to catch a couple of movies at a theatre near the garage. However, I became so interested in the films that I didn't pay attention to the time. When the last movie had finished, I looked down at my watch. It was six o'clock. I was two hours late! I knew Dad would be angry if he found out I'd been watching movies. He'd never let me drive again. I decided to tell him that the car needed some repairs and that they had taken longer than had been expected. I drove up to the place where we had planned to meet and saw Dad waiting patiently on the corner. I apologized for being late and told him that I'd come as quickly as I could, but the car had needed some major repairs. I'll never forget the look he gave me. ""I'm disappointed that you feel you have to lie to me, Jason."" ""What do you mean? I'm telling the truth."" Dad looked at me again. ""When you did not show up, I called the garage to ask if there were any problems, and they told me that you had not yet picked up the car. So you see, I know there were no problems with the car."" A feeling of guilt ran through me as I weakly confessed to my trip to the movie theatre and the real reason for my being late. Dad listened intently  as a sadness passed through him. ""I'm angry, not with you but with myself. You see, I realize that I have failed as a father if after all these years you feel that you have to lie to me. I have failed because I have brought up a son who cannot even tell the truth to his own father. I'm going to walk home now and think seriously about where I have gone wrong all these years."" ""But Dad, it's 18 miles to home. It's dark. You can't walk home."" My protests and my apologies were useless. I had let my father down and I was about to learn one of the most painful lessons of my life. Dad began walking along the dusty road. I quickly jumped in the car and followed behind, hoping he would weaken. I begged all the way, telling him how sorry I was, but he simply ignored me, continuing on silently, thoughtfully and painfully. For 18 miles I drove behind him, at a speed of about five miles per hour. Seeing my father in so much physical and emotional pain was the most distressing  and painful experience that I have ever faced. However, it was also the most successful lesson. I have never lied to him since. Why was the lesson the most successful one the boy had ever learned?"
"WHY do we sometimes struggle with moral dilemmas? Why is it a crime to take certain drugs but it's acceptable to take others? Why is it wrong to create human embryos   to cure diseases suffered by millions? Often, we follow rules that bring little benefit and can even be positively harmful. But the rules are not set in stone, so there is nothing to stop us getting rid of those that don't work and putting better ones in their place. Now an experiment suggests that morality isn't entirely about benefits to individuals. We also tend to make and obey arbitrary moral rules, probably as a way of promoting social consolidation  . A classic psychology experiment called ""trolley   experiment"" suggests that our minds have two moral systems, and they don't always agree. In the trolley experiment, participants are told that an out-of-control trolley could kill five people on the tracks. They must decide whether to turn it onto a second track with only one person on it. Almost everyone does it, sacrificing one to save five. But if instead you have to push one person off a bridge onto the track to stop the trolley, most people say no. That suggests most of us have a strict rule against killing people directly, even for the greater good. How are such rules formed? Although people with morality appear to  _ the act of killing in the bridge experiment, most moral behavior in animals appears focused on outcomes--the death of an individual, say--rather than the death of the majority. When an animal experiences harm to help a  , biologists view this as increasing the chances that the animal's genes will survive. Many psychologists think that human moral rules are an extension of this ""kin   selection"". Kurzban of the University of Pennsylvania did the experiment further. Kurzban's team gave volunteers changes of the bridge situation. Volunteers were asked what they would do and whether their actions were morally right. 85% of them said it would be morally wrong to push one person off to save five, whether these people are brothers or strangers, confirming the idea that there is a rule against killing. However, despite thinking it wrong, 28% said they would still push a stranger off to save five, while 47% said they would push a brother off to save five brothers. ""They're more likely to do this 'less moral1thing if it's to save a  ,"" Kurzban says, suggesting kin selection is at work as well as the basic ""moral rule"" against killing. The experiment shows we have at least two parallel systems for deciding right and wrong: one that says some actions, like killing, are bad, and another that tells us to protect kin. So how is this helpful? Science has made great steps in explaining morality. No longer is it seen as something handed down from on high. Sacrificing yourself so as to protect your kin, for example, can benefit your family genes. Social consolidation demands we have rules, regardless of what they are, to help settle disputes quickly and peacefully. Which action agrees with ""kin selection""?"
"A teacher of English as a second language is the 2004 Teacher of the Year in the United States .Kathy Mellor of Rhode Island will spend the next year as an international spokeswoman for education. President Bush and his wife, Laura ,honored her during a ceremony at the White House last week.    For the past nineteen years ,Kathy Mellor has taught English as a second language at Davisville Middle School in North Kingstown, Rhode Island ,in the northeastern United States .She redesigned the program for E.S.L students at her school to provide each student with one to three periods per day in classes for English learners .How much instruction the students get depends on their level of skill in listening ,speaking ,reading and writing. The amount of time they spend in these classes in reduced as their level of English increases.     A teacher describes this as the most successful E.S.L. program in North Kingstown. She also praises Kathy Mellor for providing help to students and their families by forming a local parents group for speakers of other languages .This improved their ability to help their children.    Kathy Mellor earned a master's degree in education from Rhode Island College. She studied teaching English as a second language.    She was chosen for the national honor of Teacher of the Year from among top teachers in each of the fifty states .As Teacher of the Year ,Kathy Mellor will travel around the United States and to other countries .She will talk about the importance of education and the work of teachers.

"Who is smarter? A human being or artificial intelligence ? The question swept the world last week when a Google-developed program called AlphaGo defeated the world top player, South Korean Lee Se-del, 4-1. So, what comes next? Some people have been arguing that artificial intelligence, or AI in short, will be a bad thing for humans. In an interview with the BBC in 2014, UK scientist Stephen Hawking warned that ""the development of full artificial intelligence could mean the end of the human race."" So are we really about to live in the world shown in the Terminator movies?    ""Not quite,"" answered The Economist. After all, it's not hard to get a computer program to remember and produce facts. What is hard is getting computers to use their knowledge in everyday situations. ""We think that, for the human being, things like sight and balance , are natural and ordinary in our life."" Thomas Edison, founder of Motion Figures, a company that is bringing AI to boys, told the newspaper. ""But for a robot, to walk up and down just like human beings requires various decisions to be made every second, and it's really difficult to do."" As The Economist put it, ""We have a long way to go before AI can truly begin to be similar to the human brain, even though the technology can be great."" Meanwhile, John Markoff of The New York Times said that researchers should build artificial intelligence to make people more effective. ""Our fate is in our own hands,"" he wrote. ""Since technology depends on the values of its creators, we can make human choices that use technology to improve the world."".Com] Who believes much has to be done to improve AI?"
"Scientists say they have discovered a promising treatment for sleeping sickness, a killer disease that infects  about 60,000 people in Africa a year. British and Canadian experts say drugs could attack the parasite  causing the illness needs to survive. They say the drug could be ready for human medical test in about 18 months. The disease, spread by the bite of a fly, is caused by a parasite attacking the central nervous system. It has similar symptoms  to malaria , making it difficult to diagnose. Left untreated, it moves to the brain, resulting in mental confusion and final death The ""breakthrough"" came at the University of Dundee in Scotland, where scientists were offered money to research diseases ignored by major drugs companies. Professor Paul Wyatt, director of the programme, said: ""This is one of the most significant findings made in recent years in terms of drug discovery and development for ignored diseases."" He said the research, published in the journal Nature, represented ""significant progress"" in the development of a full blown drug against the disease. The World Health Organization said there are between 50,000 and 70,000 cases of the disease a year, with a further 60 million people at risk of infection. The research in Dundee was _ by partners at the University of York in England and the Structural Genomics Consortium in Toronto, Canada. The two drugs currently available to treat sleeping sickness both have problems. One is with side effects that kill one in 20 patients and the other is costly, only partially effective and requires long-time hospital treatment, the scientists said.

"Parents who feel disappointed at their teenagers' failure to pay attention in class, and inability to sit quietly long enough to finish homework or plan ahead, should take _ . Their children are not being lazy or careless, according to new research. The research has found that teenagers' brains continue developing far longer into adulthood than we used to think. Teens may look like young adults but their brain structure is similar to that of much younger children. ""It is not always easy for teens to pay attention in class without letting their minds wander, or to ignore distractions from their younger brothers or sisters when trying to solve a maths   problem,"" said Dr Iroise Dumon-theil. ""But it's not the fault of teenagers that they can't pay attention and are easily distracted. It's to do with the structure of their brains. Teens simply can't think as well as an adult."" The research showed that the brain of a teenager works less effectively than that of an adult. ""We knew that the front of the brain of teens functioned in a chaotic    way but we  didn' t realize it continued until the late 20s or early 30s,"" said Dr Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, who led the research. Chaotic thought patterns are a result of teenagers' brains containing too much grey matter -- the cell bodies and connections which carry messages within the brain. As we age, the amount of grey matter in our brain reduces. ""What our research has shown is that there is simply too much going on in the brains of teens,"" said Blakemore. ""The result is that their brain energy and resources are wasted and their decision-making process is badly influenced. Adults, on the other hand, have less grey matter. This means that the brain works far more effectively."" When making decisions,   _  ."
"Experts believe that storms and severe weather in North America and Asia have disrupted bird flight paths across the world and swept huge numbers of bird species towards the British Isles. Birds flying to the other side of the Atlantic or to the Pacific to lay their eggs have been trapped in Britain and Ireland, adding their numbers to native species, and causing great excitement in the bird-watching community. Local birdwatchers have already observed a total of 442 species in the British Isles this year. The highest number ever seen in one year is 445, in 2008. ""We only need four more to break our record,"" said Lee Evans, who runs the British Birding Association. ""With three months to go I'm sure we'll do it."" Last month an extremely rare Siberian Rubythroat bird was seen in Scotland, sending hundreds of birdwatchers north in the hope of catching a glimpse of this colourful Asian beauty. Another very uncommon bird, the bufflehead duck was cited in Cornwell and caused similar excitement. ""I couldn't believe it,"" said Evans. ""The poor thing was completely  _ . It must have been blown to England by the storms while trying to fly from Canada to the southern United States for the winter. That's 3000 miles!"" Evans said that global warming over the past decade was playing a key role in transforming bird movements across the world. In addition, melting Arctic sea ice may also be opening up bird flight paths over the North Pole, making it easier for birds from the Pacific -- such as the slaty-backed gull and tufted puffin, both of which appeared in London earlier this year -- to reach Britain. Bird-watching is becoming an increasingly popular hobby among all age groups, added Evans. ""A fifth of our members are under 18. This is a round-the-year hobby that you can enjoy from the kitchen window or from a car. More and more people are bird-watching, and as a result more and more unexpected species are being spotted in the British Isles."" How many more bird species are needed to equal the British bird-watching record?"
"It doesn't look like the heart of a green revolution. The huge chimneys stick up above the line of pine trees and don't make for the most scenic view as you wander around the clear blue waters of the nearby lake. But it is this power plant that has helped the small Swedish city of Vaxjo become arguably the greenest place in Europe. On closer observation, the only thing emerging from the chimneys is the faintest mists of steam. And inside it smells more like a sauna  than a furnace . That's because it is not oil fuelling the plant, but woodchip and other wood waste from the area's sawmills. And as well as generating electricity, it also supplies 90 per cent of this southern Swedish town with heating and hot water.[:Zxxk.Com] The gases produced as the wood burns are changed into liquid form, and are purified before they reach the chimney. And instead of wasting this liquid, the power plant pumps it around town. Some runs out of the town's public taps; the rest is directed through pipes that run through individual heaters, warming homes and offices. The pile of wood chippings in the yard towers above head height and takes almost five minutes to walk around. That's enough to keep Vaxjo warm on the snowiest day in winter, or supply it with hot water for a fortnight in summer, and it's good way of using the paper industry's waste. As well as the centuries-- old Swedish policy of planting a new tree for every one felled, the ashes swept out of the furnace each day find their way back to the forest as fertilizer . It was this green plant that netted Vaxjo the European Union's award for sustainable development, making it the greenest city on the continent. However, it is not just the citizen's consciences and moral histories to which the town's current day authorities are appealing. They know how to talk to their wallets too. Oil-generated electricity costs about 16,000 kronor a year(PS1,170) per person, while the new power plant's electricity comes in at two thirds of the price. They've been planning for over ten years to become a ""Fossil Fuel Free City"". But according to Anders Franzen, the head of planning and development department at the city council: ""The battle in the energy sector has been won, yes, but the next battleground is transport."" What's the main reason for ""inside it smells more like a sauna than a furnace""?"
"We're trying to decide where to go on our vacation this summer. We usually go to the Lake Arrowhead for a few weeks, but we'd like to go somewhere else this year.

In the first place, it would be rather expensive, and in the second place, there wouldn't be enough time. If we're lucky enough to save some money between now and next summer, and if I'm lucky enough to get four weeks of vacation instead of two weeks, maybe we can go to Hawaii next year. As a matter of fact, if we wanted to plan a trip like that, it might be advisable to stay home this summer and not go any place. That's one way we could begin to save some money for next year's trip. Also, if we were to stay here, I could offer to work instead of taking two weeks off; then maybe my boss would suggest that I be given four weeks' vacation next summer instead of two weeks.

"Recently, a small group of birdwatchers spent three weeks around Mount Vernon. They were busy counting wild birds on Mount Vernon's wetlands, south of Washington, D.C. They began in the middle of December and worked until the beginning of January, 2015. The birdwatchers were among 70,000 volunteers who collected information for the National Audubon Society, a U.S. conservation group. They counted birds in more than 2,400 areas in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean Sea and other parts of the Americas. The Audubon Society's first ""Christmas Bird Count"" took place 115 years ago in 1900. At that time, a man named Frank Chapman suggested a new Christmas tradition that people count birds instead of shooting them around the holiday. Harry Glasgow has taken part in the Christmas Bird Count for the past 10 years. This year, he was one of the volunteer birdwatchers at Mount Vernon. ""I think it's a tremendous use of a lot of unofficial talent around the nation to keep track of birds. Birds are one of the surest indicators of the health of ecology."" Last year, the bird count recorded over 66 million birds of 2,403 different species. Gary Langham is chief scientist with the National Audubon Society. ""The Audubon climate report says that half the birds in North America -- 314 out of 588 species -- are seriously threatened by climate change. The impacts sort of cut across all birds, all sizes, all kinds, all places."" Information from the bird counts has shown that birds are staying farther north during the winter months because of warmer weather. Birdwatcher Jaime Reidy has noted the difference close to Washington, in the state of Virginia. ""You get to see them at odd times of the year, a little earlier, staying a little later."" Gary Langham says other conditions are affecting bird populations. ""You can imagine the birds that live along the beach or along the rocky shore line as sea levels are rising around the world. That is impacting them, you know."" David Yarnold is president of the Audubon Society. In his words, ""Christmas Bird Count data is becoming important not only in documenting current climate change, but in predicting the future effects of climate change on North American bird populations. If we know what to expect, we can start taking actions now to do something about it."" Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?"

"Language as a System of Symbols Of all systems of symbols , language is the most highly developed. It has been pointed out that human beings, by agreement, can make anything stand for anything. Human beings have agreed, in the course of centuries of mutual  dependency, to let the various noises that they can produce with their lungs, throats, tongues, teeth, and lips systematically stand for certain happenings in their nervous systems. We call that system of agreements language. There is no necessary connection between the symbol and that which it stands for. Just as social positions can be symbolized by feathers worn on the head, by gold on the watch chain, or by a thousand other things according to the culture we live in, so the fact of being hungry can be symbolized by a thousand different noises according to the culture we live in. However obvious these facts may appear at first glance, they are actually not so obvious as they seem except when we  _ to think about the subject. Symbols and the things they stand for are independent of each other, yet we all have a way of feeling as if, and sometimes acting as if, there were necessary connections. For example, there are people who feel that foreign languages are unreasonable by nature: foreigners have such funny names for things, and why can't they call things by their right names? This feeling exhibits itself most strongly in those English and American tourists who seem to believe that they can make the natives of any country understand English if they shout loud enough. Like the little boy who is reported to have said: ""Pigs are called pigs because they are such dirty animals,"" they feel the symbol is inherently  connected in some way with the things symbolized. The example of the little boy is used to show that   _  ."

The Scandinavian countries of Norway,Sweden and Denmark also all make the top five in a'quality-of-lif e'index where it is best to be born next year. One of the most important factors is being rich,but other factors come into play including crime,trust in public institutions and the health of family life. In total,the index takes into account 11 factors. These include fixed factors such as geography,others that change slowly over time such as demography   social and cultural characteristics, and the state of the world economy. The index also looks at income per head in 2030,which is roughly when children born in 2013 will reach adulthood. Small economies take up the top 10 countries,with Australia coming second and New Zealand and the Netherlands not too far behind. Half of the top 10 countries are European,but only one,the Netherlands,is from the eurozone.

"Do you have any skiing equipment you no longer need? A ski school in the far north of India could put it to good use. In March we published a photo story about the extraordinary Zsnskar region in northern India,which is cut off from the outside world for more than seven months of the year,and only accessible  via a frozen river.We also included information about the limited use of skiing in the region and the recent creation of the Zanskar Ski School: ""Despite the difficulties of travelling through the region when the snow comes,skiing hasn't traditionally been used as a means of transport by the locals,largely because trees don't grow here, so there is little in the way of raw materials from which to make skis.In 1995, a group of British scientists in the region noticed the lack of skis and one of them returned to set up the Zanskar Ski School in Padam.The school provides lessons for a small fee and rents skis to the local people. Among the benefits that the school hopes to bring are improved education--children often find it difficult to get to school through the deep snow--and the possibility of offering ski tours to tourists in the future.So far,more than 300 local people have received training,and local doctors and policemen regularly borrow skis."" But what we weren't able to include in the article is that the ski school is always on the look out for old skiing equipment--particularly of a size suitable for children--and, I thought.

"""How are you?"" is a nice question. It's a friendly way that people in the USA greet each other. But ""How are you"" is also a very unusual question. It's a question that often doesn't need an answer. The person who asks ""How are you?"" hopes to hear the answer "" Fine"", even if the person's friend isn't fine. The reason is that ""How are you?"" isn't really a question and ""Fine"" isn't really an answer. They are simply other ways of saying ""Hello"" or ""Hi"". Sometimes, people also don't say exactly what they mean. For example, when someone asks ""Do you agree?"" the other person might think, ""No, I disagree. I think you're wrong..."" But it isn't very polite to disagree so strongly, so the other person might say ""I'm not sure."" It's a nicer way to say that you don't agree with someone. People also don't say exactly what they are thinking when they finish talking with other people. For example, may talks over the phone finish when one person says ""I've to go now."" Often, the person who wants to hang up gives an excuse ""Someone's at the door."" ""Something is burning on the stove."" The excuses might be real, or not. _ The excuse is more polite, and it doesn't hurt the other person. Whether they are greeting each other, talking about an idea, or finishing a talk, people don't say exactly that they are thinking. It's an important way that people try to be nice to each other, and it's part of the rule of the game of language. The rule of the game of language is probably ""  _  ""."
"Most people don't know the true story of the little boy who came to be known as Douglas Craig. He was found wandering around the streets of Washington D.C. He could not hear or speak. Sometimes people pitied him and gave him food and clothing. If not, he ate what he could find in garbage cans.     It is said that a man named Craig found the little boy and took him to Dr. E. M. Gallaudet at Gallaudet College. Dr Gallaudet gave him the first name of Douglas, and the last name of Craig, after the man who found him.     Dr Gallaudet placed Douglas in the Kendall School, and he stayed there until he was old enough to work. He spent his life working in and around the halls of Gallaudet.     Once he courted   a black woman from Baltimore. Since his courtship required letter-writing, and he was illiterate, he had a student in the college act as his ""private secretary"". Though that relationship did not work out, he did finally marry. Later, he married a black deaf woman from Washington D.C. The wedding and reception took place in a church near the college.     The happy couple went to Baltimore for a honeymoon, but the honeymoon only lasted for one day. Their plans were cut short when Douglas's pocketbook containing about $300 was either lost or stolen.     Douglas never got very far from Washington D.C. and Gallaudet College was his world. He went to Norfolk, Virginia, once on a vacation, but he did not know what a vacation was. He spent the entire time working around the docks of Norfolk. He came home with a pocket of money, and told everyone that he had a fine vacation.     Douglas's last public duty was to raise the flag to the top of the new flagpole in front of College Hall. He died on February 11, 1936, but left a story at Gallaudet that would live forever. What did Gallaudet College mean to Craig?"

"On Easter Day, 1722, Dutch explorers   landed on Easter Island  . It was the first time that Easter Islanders had met people from the outside world. The strangers were about to discover something very strange themselves --that they were on an island with hundreds of huge stone statues  . The Dutch explorers wondered where the Islanders had come from and why and how they had built the statues. Now science is putting together the story.     The first people to arrive on the island came there around A.D. 700. The society that developed there was based on fishing and farming to feed the population, which grew to 12,000. Its success showed itself in a way that has become the island's trademark  : hundreds of huge stone figures --the moai.     None of the moai was standing when scientists first arrived. People put them back up later; but how had a Stone Age society ever made, moved and set them up there in the first place? And why?     There are nearly 900 moai on Easter Island, and while the questions about them remain unanswered, no one doubts the years of effort that must have gone into making them.     The real killer of the Easter Islanders came from across the ocean. After 1722, it became popular for explorers to visit Easter Island, bringing diseases. The final blow   came in 1862, when slave traders came from Peru and took away 1,500 people, one-third of the population. When the first explorers arrived on the island, they   _  ."

Bryan Jaycox and his wife opened The Build Shop LLC in Los Angeles two years ago.The store is filled with tools like a laser cutter, an industrial sewing machine and 3D printers.Bryan Jaycox requires $ 15 an hour to print an object.He also charges a fee depending on the size of the object and up to $ 50 an hour for design and labor services.

""I think 3D printing is going to be huge. It's going to make a huge impact on society as a whole,"" he added.

"As we all know , the language is a very important tool for people to communicate with each other. In most of the languages , people usually begin their conversations by a kind of small talk -a casual form of conversation that ""breaks the ice"" or fills an awkward silence between people . That is to say , small talk means the little things we talk about to start a conversation . In English-speaking countries such as Britain, people often make small talk about the weather. "" Nice day, isn't it?"" ""Terrible weather , isn't it?"" However, we still have something special about small talk. It must be about something which both people have the same opinion about. The purpose of small talk is to let both people agree on something. This makes meeting people easier and more comfortable . People usually agree about the weather, so it is a safe topic for small talk. But people often disagree about religion or politics so these are not suitable topics for small talk. The topics for small talk also depend on where the conversation is taking place. At basketball matches, people make small talk about the game they are watching. ""Great game , isn't it?"" At train stations, people may talk about the transport system . "" The train service is terrible, isn't it?"" According to the passage , small talk is   _  ."
"Artistic Skates Artistic roller skates are made up of a leather boot, very strong sole plate, and a jump bar that adds extra force. The boot sits a few inches above the ankle, providing more support for the foot. Jam Skates Jam skates are the most different roller skates because of their special low-cut design and lack of toe stop. That's right: there is no brake. But the original jam skate design was different, resembling an artistic skate. Jam skating is more about personal expression rather than speed skating. The free-flowing movements of jam skating have been given many names. But regardless of its name, jam skating has always been about expression and passion. Speed Skates A speed skate resembles a shoe. The cut of the boot is lower. Speed skates typically offer lightweight plates to reduce exhaustion for skating long distances. Jam skates have preferred speed skates because they offer a similar design and freedom of movement. The most obvious difference is that a speed skate features a toe stop, unlike a jam skate that uses a toe plug. Rhythm Skates Rhythm skates are similar to jam skates. The difference between them lies in the boot design. In fact, the boot design looks very similar to an artistic skate, essentially providing you with the ankle support benefits of an artistic skate, but the freedom of movement of a jam skate. If you want a skate that allows you to move to the beat, which added ankle support, the rhythm skate is the ideal choice. Which of the following is NOT a feature of jam skates?"

"Europe's deadly outbreak of a rare form of E. coli bacteria   has brought new attention to food safety issues. One of the problems when people get sick from food is that the simplest question is often difficult or even impossible to answer. Just what did the people eat that made them sick? Of course, one way to avoid these medical mysteries is to keep dangerous organisms out of the food supply. This is easier said than done, but scientists keep looking for new ways. Scientists in the United States have developed an experimental system that uses a high-tech optical scanner. The system is designed to identify the presence of contaminants  like soil or animal waste on fresh produce. These can be sources of E. coli. E. coli bacteria naturally live in the intestines  of humans and many animals. Most kinds of E. coli are harmless but some can make people sick. The new scanner can also show damage and imperfections that might make the produce unappealing to shoppers. Scientists designed the system at a Department of Agriculture research center in Beltsville, Maryland. Moon Kim of the Agricultural Research Service led the team. MOON KIM: ""We were requested, we were asked, to develop a method to detect contamination in produce. So we started with the apple as the model sample."" The scanner uses a high-speed camera placed over the conveyer belt that moves the produce along. As the apples move along the belt, the scanner captures images of each piece of fruit. Moon Kim says the team hopes the system will be available before long. MOON KIM: ""We are targeting for development in commercial plants for the next several years."" The scanner can direct a sorting machine to separate the bad apples from the good ones. The system is currently able to show the surface of only half the apple as it speeds by. The inventers hope to improve the process so it can show the whole surface. What is the main topic of the text?"
"The quickest way to make friends with others is to smile  . When you smile, people think you are friendly and easy to talk to. It may not be easy to smile at first, but you can practice it in front of a mirror  . When you look at yourself in the mirror, think about the difference between a smiling face and a sad or an angry face. Most people will stay away from  a sad or an angry face. The easiest way to start a conversation with someone is to say something nice about him or her. For example, you can _ someone's great answer to a teacher's question, a great prize, a nice shirt, etc. Think about how great you feel when someone says something nice to you. Doesn't it make you want to keep talking with that person? Also, ask your new friends questions about themselves. For example, who are their favorite singers and what do they do after school are all good questions to start a conversation. The following questions are good to start a conversation EXCEPT (......)        ""  _  ""."
"Many studies have been carried out to discover the benefits of listening to and playing music. The growing field of ""music treatment"" is presenting increasing amounts of proof that point to the great powers of music. Emotional  benefits The right song can put anybody in a better state. Most people turn to certain songs to make them feel better. The main reason behind this is that music can express our feelings better than any other medium. In addition, we have favorite songs for particular situations because we turn to the music which has the best effect on us. Music and exercise Have you ever noticed how out of breath you get when listening to an exciting song while doing exercises at the gym? It has been suggested that exciting music can actually increase muscle tension  , while light music does the opposite. It has also been proved that music can improve motor skills. An experiment done on a group of pupils proved that children learning basic motor skills such as throwing ,catching and jumping while listening to music did better than those with no music. Chronic pain relief  Music also has the ability to reduce chronic pain. In fact, according to a paper published in the Journal of Advanced Nursing, music can reduce chronic pain by 21%. The paper reports that 60 patients in an experiment were divided into two groups--one group listened to music, and the other did not. The results showed that people who listened to music for an hour each day for a week improved physically and psychologically  while those who did not listen to music did not.

"Does stress cause gray hair? Many people believe that tension and stress can cause your hair to lose its color.In fact,it is an old wives tale that being upset all the time can result in premature graying.Here is a closer look at this situation and why some believe that this old wives tale could be true. As one ages,the hairs on the head also age.In fact,just about everything on the human body begins to show signs of wear and tear after a while.The joints wear and become stiff and skin wears and becomes wrinkled.Hairs on the head grow and eventually die.They are replaced,but in the process something else happens. When new hairs are replaced,the color or pigment is also added to them.However,as one ages,this pigment becomes less and less available.At first,hairs will have a limited amount of pigment and they will appear to be grayish in color.In time,they will lose all of their pigment and will be white.Many things are known to cause graying.and genetics is a very powerful factor.If one of your parents turns gray at an early age,there is a good chance that you will too.Some people begin the graying process in high school,while others may be over the age of forty. Constant worry and tension can have many harmful effects on the human body.It is a known fact that stressful times can cause one to suffer hair loss.It would make sense that if it can cause these problems,perhaps it also may contribute to graying.However,there is no sound evidence to support this. On the other hand,many medical professionals believe that there may be a link:between graying and a constant state of anxiety or tension.Does stress cause gray hair? There is no scientific evidence to support the theory,but it is best to avoid stressful situations. From the passage we can infer that    _    ."

The New York Times received suggestions recently from PhD students and seniors at some of the top universities . Here is their advice. ""Many young people today are raised in a protective cocoon "", wrote Tim Novikoff, a PhD student at Comell. ""College is a time to explore the world beyond and a chance to learn new things about yourself. Take classes in different subjects. Try lots of different clubs and activities."" Remember also to take some time away from campus, suggested Willie Lin, a student at Washington University. "" _ "" Try to find work assisting a researcher or a professor---this is the advice from Aman Singh Gill, a PhD student at Stony Brook University. And he also said, ""With a window into the world of research, you will find yourself thinking more critically, accepting fewer states at face value and perhaps developing a brave sense of what you can accomplish."" Many young people can't imagine even a single day without devices such as computers and cell phones. But try to keep yourself off them, cautioned Christine Smallwood, a PhD student at Columbia University. Start by scheduling a few Internet-free hours each day, with your phone turned off. It's the only way you'll be able to read anything serious. ""This will also have the benefit of making you harder to reach, and thus more mysterious and fascinating to new friends and acquaintances ,"" she suggested.

"New picture The National Gallery now has a fine _ by the 18th century Dutch painter Jan van Os.This large picture (89.1 cm x 71cm) of flowers and fruit is painted in light bright colours on wood.It is one of the first pictures of this type in the Gallery.The picture is signed and dated 1777 and 1778.It is not unusual for a picture to be dated two years: the artist waited for particular flowers to come out in their different seasons in order to paint them.This picture was given to the Gallery by Miss Violet Churchman in memory of her sister Ida Nancy. It is now on show in Room 25. Special exhibition The exhibition ""Painting in Spain During the Late 18th Century"" opened in the Sunley Room on 15 March.Recently the Gallery has bought works by three Spanish painters of this period--Paret, Melendez and Francisco Bayeu, who are the focus of the exhibition.These three artists are also joined by Francisco's brother Ramon, by Antonio Gonzalez and two Italians who worked in Spain during these years--Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.The exhibition runs until 31 May. Lecture news    Lectures will be given along with the special exhibition every Wednesday.On 8 April, Lizzie Barker will discuss the work of Melendez, while on 15 April, Sarah Symmons will lecture on Luis Patter.On 22 and 29 April, Juliet Wilson will talk about Francisco Bayeu.On 25 April, a Saturday, Erika Langmuir will explain how artists often ""tell a story"" through their pictures.

"If you're a male and you're reading this, congratulations: you're a survivor. According to statistics, you are more than twice as likely to die of skin cancer as a woman, and nine times more likely to die of AIDS. Assuming you make it to the end of your natural term, about 78 years for men in Australia, you'll die on average five years before a woman. There are many reasons for this--typically, men take more risks than women and are more likely to drink and smoke--but perhaps more importantly, men don't go to the doctor. ""Men aren't seeing doctors as often as they should,"" says Dr. Gullotta. ""This is particularly so for the over-40s, when diseases tend to strike."" Gullotta says a healthy man should visit the doctor every year or two. For those over 45, it should be at least once a year. Two months ago Gullotta saw a 50-year-old man who had delayed doing anything about his smoker's cough for a year. ""When I finally saw him it had already spread and he has since died from lung cancer,"" he says. ""Earlier detection and treatment may not have cured him, but it would have prolonged his life."" According to a recent survey, 95% of women aged between 15 and early 40s see a doctor once a year, compared to 70% of men in the same age group. ""A lot of men think they're undefeatable,"" Gullota says. ""They only come in when a friend drops dead on the golf course and they think, 'Geez, if it could happen to him, ...'"" Then there's the ostrich approach. ""Some men are scared of what might be there and would rather not know,"" says Dr. Ross Cartmill. ""Most men get their cars serviced more regularly than they service their bodies,"" Cartmill says. He believes most diseases that commonly affect men could be addressed by preventive check-ups. Regular check-ups for men would inevitably place strain on the public purse, Cartmill says. ""But prevention is cheaper in the long run than having to treat the diseases. Besides, the ultimate cost is far greater: it is called premature death."" What does Cartmill say about regular check-ups for men?"
"Around the World in Eighty Daysis a classic Adventure novel by Jules Verne. The story starts in London in 1872. One day in the Reform Club, Phileas Fogg, a wealthy gentleman, accepts a wager  for PS20,000, which he will receive if he travels around the world in 80 days. Phileas Fogg sets off immediately, with his servant Passepartout. They reach Suez  quickly. While landing in Egypt, he is watched by a British detective named Fix, who is in search of a bank robber. Because Fix mistakes Fogg for the criminal, he follows secretly, as they are getting on a ship to Bombay. After more than 20-days of travelling, they arrive in San Francisco, and then get on the train to New York. During that trip, the train is attacked by Indians, who take Passepartout away. With some soldiers' help, Fogg succeeds in freeing his companion. To make up for the lost time, Fogg and his companion hasten on to New York, and catch the steamer for the crossing of the Atlantics. They arrive in Ireland in time to reach London before the deadline. However, once on British soil again, Fix arrests Fogg. Although the misunderstanding is quickly cleared up--the actual bank robber had been caught several days earlier. Fogg has missed the train and returns to London five minutes late, sure that he has lost the wager. However, the next day Fogg learns from the priest that he is mistaken in the date, which he thinks Sunday but which actually is Saturday, due to the fact that they gained a full day on their journey around the globe, by crossing the International Date Line.

"I've spent over a year in India, and in those 365 plus days, I've learned a lot about getting around Indian cities. My biggest lessons have been learned through being cheated, particularly by taxi and rickshaw   drivers, but that doesn't mean those are bad ways to travel, as long as you know what you're doing. Below are the best ways to get around the city of Delhi, India, and tips for how to keep from being the victim of scams  . Taking taxis is a great way to get around the city of Delhi and chances are, if you arrive in Delhi by plane, as soon as you make it through customs, you'll be swarmed by Indian taxi drivers. At the Delhi airport, be sure to arrange for a taxi to your hotel at one of the two Delhi Traffic Police Taxi Booths. One is inside the airport, and one is outside. The key is to make sure to go to a booth run by the police, rather than by independent taxi drivers. Rickshaws are one of my favorite ways to get around Indian cities, partly because it's how the locals often travel. Auto-rickshaws are more common, but bicycle rickshaws are still used in Old Delhi. If you do have a chance to take a bicycle rickshaw, you should do it at least once for a unique experience that should only set you back about 15 rupees. Auto-rickshaw rates around Delhi range between 30 and 80 rupees, depending on distance. If you really want to travel around Delhi like the locals, take a public bus. Indian buses become very crowded and most do not have air conditioning. They are, however, very cheap. A bus trip won't set you back any more than 15 rupees, as long as you stay within the city limits. Since Indian buses get so crowded, try to board the bus at the start of the route so you can get a seat. The train is a great way to get around within the city of Delhi. Fares are reasonable, between six and 22 rupees. All departure announcements are in both Hindi and English, and tokens can be purchased for between six and 22 rupees.

"Expressions about water are almost as common as water itself. But many of the expressions using water have unpleasant meanings. The expression ""to be in hot water"" is one of them. It is a very old expression. ""Hot water"" was used 500 years ago to mean being in trouble. One story says it got that meaning from the custom of throwing extremely hot water down on enemies attacking a castle. That no longer happens. But we still get in ""hot water"".When we are in ""hot water"", we are in trouble. It can be any kind of trouble--serious or not so serious. A person who breaks a law can be in hot water with the police. A young boy can be in hot water with his mother. if he walks in the house with dirty shoes. Being in ""deep water"" is almost the same as being in hot water. When you are in deep water, you are in a difficult position. Imagine a person who cannot swim being thrown in water over his head. You are in deep water when you are facing a problem that you do not have the ability to solve. The problem is too deep. You can be in deep water, for example, if you invest in stocks without knowing anything about the stock market. ""To keep your head above water"" is a colorful expression that means staying out of debt. A company seeks to keep its head above water during economic hard times. A man who loses his job tries to keep his head above water until he finds a new job. ""Water over the dam"" is another expression about a past event. It is something that is finished. It cannot be changed. The expression comes from the idea that water that has flowed over a dam cannot be brought back again. If a person tries to keep his head out of water,we can say that  _  ."

"Galaxy saw a man and a woman who communicated with the sign language at the train station when she was on the way home one evening. She noticed that the woman asked the mon for the direction. He told her that he did not know. Galaxy decided to help them. She had learned the sign language when she served as a volunteer in the deaf and mute school. Then she showed the woman the direction and left her email address to them in case they needed her help later. She received an email from that man the next day. Kazrim was his name. Galaxy replied his mail sincerely. They both started chatting online soon after and began seeing each other. Although they only communicated with the sign language, it never bothered her. Galaxy was fond of him gradually. Obviously, Kazrim was the same too. He presented Galaxy with a bunch of sunflowers and asked her sincerely, ""Are you willing to be my girlfriend?"" Galaxy was pleasantly surprised. She requested him to give her some time to persuade her parents. As she had expected, her parents were very angry after they had learned of their love story. Galaxy explained, ""Kazrim is an excellent and a very optimistic person. He has a very positive attitude towards life and work. He cares for others always. He is 100% better than the normal. Moreover, the mute is still a human. He should possess a perfect and wonderful love. "" Her parents asked to see him, then. The very worried Galaxy took Kazrim home a few days later. When they were on the train, Kazrim told her, ''I'm going to tell your parents I'll be looking after you well with all my life!"" Galaxy was deeply moved. As soon as they had entered the house, Galaxy introduced him to her parents. She said, ''This is Kazrim."" Just right after her speech, an unbelievable thing happened. Kazrim threw the gift away and held her in his arms tightly. He said, ""YOU CAN TALK?"" It was the same question that Galaxy wanted to ask, too. The four people were shocked all of a sudden. As a matter of fact, Kazrim always believed that Galaxy was a mute and he still fell in love with her deeply. How did Galaxy and Kazrim get to know each other?"
"I am Greek,and my family go to Greece every summer.Uncle Spyro and my God-mother Aunt Aspa lived about 45 minutes outside of Athens.Every summer when we traveled to Greece.we would spend a couple of days with them.     I remember all then things we would do there..We would shake almonds   off the branches of Uncle Spyro's  almond tree.Using his strong hands,he would break the shells off.and present us with the shiny white nut.With Aunt Aspa we would pick lemons off her lemon trees and carry them inside the small house with the help of Uncle Spyro.Drinking the fresh lemonade  and eating the delicious almonds,we would sit on the porch and talk.Uncle Spyro and Aunt Aspa didn't  speak English,and my Greek wasn't  and still isn't perfect.But those peacefully  quiet times on the porch were the times that I miss the most.     Uncle Spyro developed cancer from smoking for most of his life and he became very sick. We didn't go to Greece in 2000,but we planned on going again in 2001.We found out that Uncle Spyro was in the hospital shortly before we left for Greece.My mother,Alethea,and I wanted to see him.But we waited until the day after we arrived.Now,I wish that we had gone the first daywe had arrived and that we had seen him for the last time. But my uncle didn't wait for us to go.     We still Visit Aunt Aspa,and we still pick almonds and lemons.We still drink the fresh lemonade and eat the delicious almonds on the porch.But somehow the lemonade isn't  as fresh and the almonds aren't as delicious as before.     I thank God that I'm still here to comfort Aunt Aspa and that I'm still here to finish my life.I'm not afraid of death anymore like some people.And I know that when I do die,I'll just be going up to Uncle Spyro,and we'll eat almonds and drink lemonade,just like before.

"When the Japanese attacked America's ships at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941,they did it secretly.The makers of the movie Pearl Harbor have behaved differently. The noise about Pearl Harbor,made by Disney,has reached its highest point with its premiere  before the movie opens in cinemas across the US at the start of the Memorial Day holiday weekend,a time to recall national heroes who sacrificed their lives on the battlefield. As Ben Affleck is the main star,the movie seems sure to become a success in the United States at least. At almost three hours in length,it promises to be a good old Hollywood movie.There is a love story.Affleck and his co-star,Josh Hartnett,both fall in love with the navy nurse,Kate Beckinsale and,of course,there is much human courage and love of country. It's certain that Disney will be accused of ""changing"" history.The showing of actual events in a movie always causes arguments. Bits of the story are deliberately not mentioned in the movie.It does not address the theory held by some historians that President Franklin Roosevelt knew about Japan's intention to attack the ships in Pearl Harbor.It is said he did nothing,as he was aware that such a blow would allow him to take America into the Second World War. Japan remains sensitive about being accused of wartime atrocities .And Disney is sensitive about its business in Japan,where it has a theme park. Not all the reviews of the movie have been full of praise.A reviewer for Newsweek,who was given an early preview,acknowledged that the 40-minute sequence  showing the attack itself was powerful.The attack comes quite late in the movie,however,and the reviewer was less impressed with the characters and the love story. ""Almost every line of the dialogue sounds like it comes from an old movie,"" the reviewer wrote. According to the passage,what does the reviewer for Newsweek think of the movie?"

"The food in White Rose Restaurant was cheap and good, but nobody seemed to want to eat there. There were very few people going to eat there. The owner was very worried about it. Then he thought of a good idea. A few weeks later, his restaurant was always full of men and their girlfriends.  Whenever a gentleman came with a lady, a kind waiter would give each of them a beautiful menu. The menus looked exactly the same on the outside, but there was an important difference inside. The menu that the waiter handed to the man gave the correct price for each dish and each bottle of wine, while the menu that he handed to the lady gave a much higher price! So when the man calmly ordered dish after dish and wine after wine, the lady thought he was much more generous than he really was! The man could make a good impression on the lady. What does the story mainly suggest?"
"Americans are proud of their variety and individuality,yet they love and respect few things more than a uniform,whether it is the uniform of an elevator operator or the uniform of a fivestar general. Why are uniforms so popular in the United States? Among the arguments for uniforms,one of the first is that in the eyes of most people they look more professional than civilian clothes. People have become conditioned to expect superior quality from a man who wears a uniform. The television repairman who wears a uniform tends to inspire more trust than one who appears in civilian clothes. Faith in the skill of a garage mechanic  is increased by a uniform. What easier way is there for a nurse,a policeman,a barber,or a waiter to lose professional identity than to step out of uniform? Uniforms also have many practical benefits. They save on other clothes. They save on laundry bills. They are taxdeductible .They are often more comfortable and more durable than civilian clothes. Primary  among the arguments against uniforms is their lack of variety and the consequent loss of individuality experienced by people who must wear them. Though there are many types of uniforms,the wearer of any particular type is generally stuck with it,without change,until retirement. When people look alike,they tend to think,speak,and act similarly,on the job at least. Uniforms also give rise to some practical problems. Though they are longlasting,often their initial expense is greater than the cost of civilian clothes. Some uniforms are also expensive to maintain(,),requiring professional dry cleaning rather than the home laundering  possible with many types of civilian clothes. The chief function of a uniform is to   _  ."
"No one would much like the idea of eating 61 pounds of tomatoes a day. But if their goodness was put into an easy-to-swallow pill that you were told might prevent strokes  and heart attacks you would probably be putting in an order tomorrow. Researchers believe they may have come up with just that after trials. The daily pill contains a chemical called lycopene which makes tomatoes red and is known to break down fat in the vessels . A Cambridge University study found taking the pills improved blood flow and the lining of vessels in patients with pre-existing heart conditions. It also increased the flexibility  of their vessels by 50 percent. The scientists believe it could limit the damage caused by heart disease-responsible for 180,000 deaths a year-and help cut the 49,000 deaths a year from strokes. They also hope it could benefit those with arthritis , diabetes  and even slow the progress of cancer. Each pill is equal to eating around 61 pounds of ripe tomatoes. Studies have shown eating a Mediterranean-style diet rich in tomatoes fish, vegetables, nuts and olive oil can significantly reduce cholesterol  and help prevent cardiovascular disease. Preliminary results from a two-month trial, in which the pill was given to 36 heart disease patients and 36 healthy volunteers with an average age of 67, were presented at a meeting of the American Heart Association. It was shown to improve the function of the endothelium- the layer of cells lining blood vessels. It also improved their sensitivity to nitric oxide, the gas which causes the enlargement of the vessels in response to exercise. Ian Wilkinson, head of Cambridge University's clinical trials unit, said ""These results are potentially very significant and it meets the goal, but we need more trials to see if they translate into fewer heart attacks and strokes."" Further studies are planned, with researchers hoping it could offer a choice for heart disease sufferers who can not take the cholesterol-lowing drugs. Mike Knapton, head of the British Heart Foundation, said, ""Although this showed lycopene improved blood flow in people with heart disease, that's a long way from demonstrating that taking it could improve outcomes for people with heart disease. The best way to get the benefits of a good diet is to eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables."" What Was Ian Wilkinson's opinion on the trial?"
"""Mind over matter"" is an English saying meaning that we can control our bodies with our minds. Now scientists are finding increasing evidence that our mind can have a great effect on our physical health. Since our mind influences how we feel, it's not true to say if someone is ill just because he feels ill. The influence of the mind on how well we feel is the basis of what is known as the placebo effect. A placebo (which is Latin for ""I shall please"") is a harmless, inactive substance. Patients are sometimes given placebo pills and begin to feel better because they believe that they have been given real drugs and expect to respond to them. The placebo effect is very strong: research on pain suggests that up to 30% of the effect of most painkillers is a placebo effect. So if it is so powerful, why don't doctors use it today? According to Dr Persaud, they really do. ""All these things like seeing a doctor, going to a hospital, and being scanned  have a very strong placebo effect,"" he says. From the passage it can be seen that there will be no placebo effect if a patient ."
"Cities with high levels of homeownership--in the range of 75%, like Detroit and St. Lous -had on average considerably lower levels of economic activity and much lower wages and incomes. Far too many people in financial problems are trapped in homes they can't sell, unable to move on to new centers of opportunity. The cities and regions with the lowest levels of homeownership--in the range of 55% to 60% like Los Angeles and New York--had healthier economies and higher incomes. They also had higher levels of happiness and well-being. I was shocked to read these interesting points that Richard Florida made in his recent article. Let me try to understand. The people in Detroit and St. Louis are less happy than the people in New York, and Los Angeles. And, the reason is because of home ownership rates? First, to compare them to New York City (the economic capital of the world), Los Angeles (the entertainment capital of the world) seems unfair. Most people in almost any other city in the world might be less happy! Next, let's try a different way of determining whether renters are happier than homeowners. Why don't we ask them? Fannie Mae's National Housing Survey 2010 reported:    75% of current renters believe owning a home makes more sense. 67% plan to buy a home at some point in the future. When they asked current renters for the major reason to buy a house, these were their answers (they could pick several answers): 78% said it was a good place to raise children. 75% said because they would feel safe. 70% said because you have control your own space. If you believe renters are happier, you would also have to believe the majority enjoy living in a less safe environment, which wouldn't be a good place to raise children and would be a place where they have less control of their space. ks5u From Fannie Mae's survey report, we can know that  _  ."

Which best explains how this rate of human growth can harm the environment on which humans depend?"
"LONDON, England(CNN)-- The youngest person to sail solo around the world returned home Thursday from his 30,000-mile, 282-day ocean journey. Mike Perham, 17, sailed into Lizard Point in Cornwall, the southernmost point in Britain, at 9:47 a.m., his race team said. ""It feels  ly brilliant,"" Mike told CNN by phone hours before crossing the finish line. ""I'm really, really excited to be going across the line at last. It doesn't feel like long since I crossed it first."" Mike set off on his round-the-world trip on November 18, 2008. He has been sailing his yacht, TotallyMoney.com, single-handedly, though a support team has been sailing next to him along the way. ks5u The teen has now achieved the title of Youngest Sailor to Circumnavigate the Globe Solo, according to the Guinness World Records. Mike learned how to sail when he was seven years old from his father, Peter and at age 14, he sailed across the Atlantic alone. The teenager's school -- which Mike describes as ""highly supportive"" of his trip -- has redesigned his coursework to fit in with his trip. It also gave him some coursework to do during ""quiet moments,"" according to Mike's Website. There haven't been many of those quiet moments. Repeated autopilot failures forced him to stop for repairs in Portugal, the Canary Islands, South Africa, and twice in Australia, according to his Web site. Bad weather in the Southern Ocean -- between Australia and Antarctica -- forced Mike to battle 50ft waves and 57 mph winds. He said at one point, a ""freak wave"" picked up the boat and turned it on its side.  ""My feet were on the ceiling at the time,"" he told CNN. ""That was a really hairy moment, and I was certainly thinking, 'Why am I here?' But we took the sails off and the day after I thought, 'This is brilliant!'"" Mike describes his father as his biggest hero, always supportive of what he wanted to achieve. Peter Perham said he wasn't too worried about his son facing dangerous situations at sea, as long as he knew what to do and stayed safe. We can infer from the passage that   _  ."
"The only survivor of one of the two Sandy Hook Elementary School first-grade classrooms where Adam Lanza shot and killed 20 children tricked the gunman by playing dead,the girl's pastor said. ""She ran out of the school building covered from head to toe with blood and the first thing she said to her mom was,""Mommy,I'm OK but all my friends are dead"" Pastor Jim Solomon told ABC News' Lara Spencer this weekend ""Somehow,at that moment, by God's grace,she was able to act as she was already dead.""he said. The girl, a 6-year-old whose name is not being announced for privacy reasons,was the first student to appear from the lockdown at Sandy Hook,Solomon said.He said the young girl described the shooter to her mom in a way that only a young child can. ""Well, she saw someone who she felt was angry and someone she felt was very mad,""Solomon said. ""I think it's impossible without the help of God. She has wisdom beyond her years, for sure'' Of the 20 children killed on Friday in the Newtown,Conn., school, eight were boys and l2 were girls Six staff members,all female, were also killed.

"I have recently completed my college degree. The last project was called ""Smile"". The class was asked to go out to smile at three people and document their reactions. I am a very friendly person and always smile at everyone and say hello anyway. So, I thought this would be a piece of cake. My husband, youngest son and I went out to McDonald. We were standing in line when all of a sudden everyone around us began to back away. As I turned around I smelled a horrible body odour  and saw two poor homeless men standing behind me. As I looked at the short blue-eyed gentleman closest to me, he was ""smiling"". The second man fumbled with his hands as he stood behind his friend. The young lady at the counter asked him what they wanted. He said, ""Coffee is all, Miss,"" because that was all they could afford. Then I really felt it-I embraced  the little man with the blue eyes. That is when I noticed all eyes in the restaurant were set on me, judging my every action. I smiled and asked two more breakfast meals on and gave them to the men. The blue-eyed gentleman looked up at me, with tears in his eyes, and said, ""Thank you."" When I sat down my husband smiled at me. We held hands for a moment and at that time, we knew that because of the good fortune that we had been given. I turned in my project. My teacher said, ""Can I share this?"" I slowly nodded as she got the attention of the class. She began to read and that is when I knew that we as human beings share this need to heal people and to be healed. In my own way I had touched the people at McDonald's and every soul that heard the story in the classroom. But, I graduated with one of the biggest lessons I would ever learn. What did the author think she learn from the story?"
"Do you sometimes argue about what seems to you to be a simple fact ? Do you argue whether it's cold outdoors or whether the car in front of you is going faster than the speed limit ? If you get into such arguments, try to think about the story about the six blind men and the elephant.The first blind man who felt the elephant's trunk said it was like a snake.The second who felt the elephant's side said it was like a wall, while the third said it was like a spear as he touched the animal's tusk.The fourth, who had hold of the elephant's tail insisted that it was like a rope.The fifth man said it looked like a tree as he put his arm around one the elephant's legs. The sixth, who was tall and got hold of the elephant's ears, said it was like a huge fan. Each man's idea of the animal came from his own experience.So if someone disagrees with you about a ""simple fact"", it's often because his experience in the matter is different from yours. To see how hard it is for even one person to make up his mind about a ""simple fact"", try this simple experiment.Get three large bowls.Put ice water in one.Put hot water in the second.Put lukewarm water in the third.Now put your left hand in the ice water.Put your right hand in the hot water.After thirty seconds, put both hands in the lukewarm water.Your right hand will tell you the water is cold.Your left hand will tell you it's hot !

They feel they are not as close to their parents as before. They even don't think their parents are fair   to them. Some students complain that their parents often say a lot to them, but never listen to them. Some say their parents don't allow them to play computer games when other people are doing it. Others say when they are making phone calls to friends, their parents like to ask if they're speaking to a boy or a girl. These make them very unhappy.

"High school could be a scary time for everyone. The school seems bigger; there are more kids and it's a totally new environment. In fact, it isn't that bad. High school is a lot like middle school after a while. The first day of course is always scary, and the first day of middle school must have been the same. Of course, the first few days you might get lost while looking for your classes but after a while, what seemed to be a large school really isn't. One thing that's really cool about high school is that there are so many more classes you can take. If you happen to like art, there are many art classes. In addition, there are other classes that weren't available in middle school like photography or psychology. In high school, there are a lot of things that are similar to how middle school was but at the same time, there are other opportunities available as well. There are more clubs, sports, and other activities you can join in. You're able to join in these activities and make new friends with kids with the same interest as you. These activities also give you a chance to learn something you never had the opportunity to learn before. High school has something for everyone. You just have to decide what to take part in. but there's one thing that's certain that you're going to have just as much fun in high school as you did in middle school. And if middle school wasn't that great for you, high school is a chance to make up for it. High school isn't just about having fun though. You have to be responsible while you're growing up.

"It was not until the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that exploration of the  _ world began on a large scale. European middle classes took great interest in collecting new plants. This attraction to exotic plants grew as European nations moved into other parts of the world such as Asia andprefix = st1 /Australia. Brave young men took the opportunity of going on botanical expeditions even though they were to be faced with deadly disease, near-starvation, severe environments and conflicts with the local people. Sir Joseph Banks was among the brave. In 1760, he collected vast quantities of plants in what is now known as Australia. None of these plants had been recorded by Europeans before. However, Banks was not able to bring those plants back to Europe and let them grow in his homeland because keeping plants alive during long land or sea voyages was a great challenge at that time. Large numbers of seeds failed to grow after long sea voyage or trips across land far away from Europe. In 1833 the invention of the Wardian case, a tightly sealed portable glass container, made it possible for two cases of British plants to survive the six-month journey to Australia. And the return trip in 1835 with Australian species lasted eight months at sea, all the species successfully arriving inLondon. China was a land the earliest European plant collectors would explore from time to time. . Not only did Europeans collect large numbers of plants to grow in Western gardens, but also they were very excited with the knowledge that Chinahad a vast variety of plants. A British man called Robert Fortune developed his fluency in Chinese and was disguised as a Chinese man so that he could travel aroundChinaunnoticed. He managed to ship 20,000 tea plants from Shanghai toIndia, where a successful tea industry was established. What contribution did Robert Fortune made on his many trips to the world?"

I wasn't sure my mother was ready for it. After all, it had taken 15 years to persuade her to buy an electric cooker. Even so, we packed up our old computer and delivered it to my parents' home. And so began my mother's adventure in the world of computers. It also marked the beginning of an unusual teaching task for me. I've taught people of all ages, but I never thought I would be teaching my mother how to do anything.

"With the start of the new term, students around the country exchange their fun and fashionable clothes for boring school uniforms. But not all campuses are fashion deserts. Colorful sports shoes, school bags, T-shirts and even drink containers are breathing life into campuses.  _ especially when we are doing morning exercises on the playground,"" and Qing Pei, a Senior 2 students from Shanghai Qibao High School. ""But boys wear different sports shoes and girls have different decorations  in their hair. These are the areas where you can express yourself,"" said Qing. Although it might be strange for boys to talk about fashion, they do care about what they wear in school, especially shoes, according to Qing. ""Nike and Adidas basketball shoes, although they are still the must-have items for many of my friends, are becoming out-of-date,"" Qing added. He explained, ""Since Liu Xiang ran so fast in Athens, running shoes are becoming popular in this autumn."" ""Still in fashion are the various baseball caps and American-style T-shirts with some English words printed on them,"" said Qing. Besides sports shoes and T-shirts, styles and colors of schoolbags are another chance for students to express their taste in fashion. Some bags are made more eye-catching by decorating them with small dolls. Other fashionable items are colorful drink containers, which are now popular with girls this term. ""Some teachers are surprised to see a teenager sucking a bottle like this at school and criticize it as childish regression . But some girls just love it,"" said Yang Rui, a Senior 3 student. What are becoming fashionable for schoolboys according to the passage?"
"For nearly 250 years, Debrett's has advised the British public on suitable social manners. Now, it has listed modern guide to good manners, answering the questions that most trouble the British public in 2014. Using mobile phone in public More questions are asked about mobile use than any other case. According to Debrett's, it is always rude to pay more attention to a phone than the people around you, and they should always be put away when you're paying for something in a shop. They should be turned off in theatres, cinemas or any space where silence is required. Smoking e-cigarettes at work As electronic cigarettes become more popular, questions about whether they are acceptable in the workplace are asked more often. According to Debrett's, they should never be used in a work environment. Smoking e-cigarettes at work shows that you're not focused on your work and may also have a bad influence on your workmates. Giving up your seat on public transport In a recent university experiment only 20 per cent of London tube passengers are willing to give up their seat to people in need. According to Debrett's, passengers should always offer to give up their seat to any person that is pregnant, elderly, or clearly in need. It is important to remember, however, that it is just as impolite to rudely refuse the offer of a seat as it is to not offer a seat. Eating before everyone is served The final question is one that we've all asked ourselves: is it rude to start eating at the table before everyone else has been served? According to Debrett's, the simple answer is yes, unless the host or hostess _ dinners to start. How many questions about good manners are listed in the passage?"
"After giving a talk at a high school, I was asked to pay a visit to a special student. An illness had kept the boy home, but he had expressed an interest in meeting me. I was told it would mean a great deal to him, so I agreed. During the nine-mile drive to his home, I found out something about Matthew. He had muscular dystrophy  . When he was born, the doctor told his parents that he would not live to five, and then they were told he would not make it to ten. Now he was thirteen. He wanted to meet me because I was a gold-medal power lifter, and I knew about overcoming obstacles and going for my dreams. I spent over an hour talking to Matthew. Never once did he complain or ask, ""Why me?"" He spoke about winning and succeeding and going for his dreams. Obviously, he knew what he was talking about. He didn't mention that his classmates had made fun of him because he was different. He just talked about his hopes for the future, and how one day he wanted to lift weights with me. When we had finished talking, I went to my briefcase and pulled out the first gold medal I had won and put it around his neck. I told him he was more of a winner and knew more about success and overcoming obstacles than I ever would. He looked at it for a moment, then took it off and handed it back to me. He said, ""You are a champion. You earned that medal. Someday when I get to the Olympics and win my own medal, I will show it to you."" Last summer I received a letter from Matthew's parents telling me that Matthew had passed away. They wanted me to have a letter he had written to me a few days before: From the passage we learn that    _   ."
"Security--for the information on your smart phone, as well as for the phone itself--is a hot topic these days.The truth is that you're packing a lot of sensitive information on your phone, and you should keep it safe. When it comes to physical security, iPhone users would do well to download Find My iPhone, a free app from Apple that allows you to visit a website and see your (lost, stolen or misplaced) phone on the map.You can then sound an alarm, send a message that will pop up on its screen, lock the phone or erase all your data. Android does not have an exact equivalent , but there are plenty of alternatives. A free app called Lookout offers the findmyphone feature.The paid version allows you to wipe the data from your phone remotely. Then there is your coffee shop's WiFi network.Anyone with minimal technical expert skill can snoop on  people using shared wireless networks, harvesting passwords and other personal data. Lookout will caution you when you've logged on to an insecure network, but cannot protect you once you're there. In order to protect yourself on such networks, you can use a virtual private network, or VPN. This turns all your activity into nonsense to anyone trying to read along with you from across Starbucks. It also keeps websites from tracking you and, if you're travelling, allows you to get access to sites that may be blocked in other countries. If you have an iPhone, the simplest VPN app is probably Hotspot Shield, whose distinguishing feature is said to be that it automatically kicks in each time you start browsing  , as opposed to other VPN apps that require you to start them up manually .This matters, because even if you decide you want a VPN app, you want to spend approximately zero time thinking about it. For the most part, _ was true of Hotspot Shield, though occasionally it took a while to connect or temporarily lost connection without warning. I found myself having to turn the app on and off sometimes, which involved setting my phone constantly. If even reading about the settings on your phone drive you crazy, then it is probably best to stay away from a VPN app. But if you're the type who can't resist checking your bank balance from your corner bar, the hassle  may be preferable to the risk.

"A high school history teacher once told us, ""If you make one close friend in school, you will be most fortunate. A true friend is someone who stays with you for life."" Experience teaches that he was right. Good friendships are just not easily formed. Why? One reason is that it is easy to move around in our society. Mr. Darrell Sifford, a news reporter for the Washington Daily, has been studying and talking about friendships for a number of years. He reports what one woman thought about the effect of ease of movement on friendship: ""I was nine, and we'd just moved from South Carolina to New Jersey, and I didn't know anybody. _ and she said to me, 'Amelia, I know you're feeling bad because you don't have any friends. But you can fix that. Just walk across the street -- I know there's a girl about your age over there -- and knock on the door and ask her to be your friend.'"" ""As a 9-year-old, I could do that. I knocked on the door and said, 'Hi, my name is Amelia, and I'd like for us to be friends.' And to my surprise, she said that she would like that too--and we became friends."" She added that going about it directly always worked when she was a child. But as she left childhood, she found that the simple direct approach was more and more difficult for her to follow. So, as an adult, Amelia longed to have friends but her hands were tied when it came to doing anything about it. The problem, according to her, is that society teaches us in a number of ways that direct action is not an acceptable way of doing things. We need to be less direct so that our feelings will not be hurt if our offer of friendship is refused. Mr. Sifford goes on to describe his own ideas on the subject: ""To most of us, friendship is very important, but we need to have clear in our own minds the kinds of friendships we want. Are they to be very close or kept at arm's length? Do we want to share ourselves or do we want to walk on the surface?"" ""For some people, an ordinary friendship is enough -- and that's all right. But at some point we need to make sure that what we expect from the friendship is the same as what our friends expect from it. If one wants more from the friendship than the other, and if this is not talked about, one is likely eventually to feel that he's not being given enough attention. ""The sharing of close secrets, including our fears as well as our dark dreams, is the surest way to deepen friendships. But the process must be gone through slowly and continued only if there are signs of interest and our efforts are answered."" What are some of the problems in forming friendships? According to Mr. Sifford, the biggest problem is to expect too much too soon. Deep relationships take time. Another ""big difficulty"" is to think one ""possesses"" the other and that he should spend all his time only with you. Similarly, friendships require action from both sides. In short, you must give as much as you take. Finally there is a question of developing friendship. Unless you spend enough time together, talking on the phone, writing letters, doing things together, friendships will gradually fade away. Why is it so difficult to form friendships? Perhaps it is possible, as Mr. Sifford states, that we simply do not stay in one place long enough for a true friendship to develop. However, we all agree that each of us should think carefully about the kind of friendships we want. As in all interpersonal relationships, success depends on the kind of friendship we expect to have, openness to others, and a willingness to experiment.

"The crisis at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear energy center caused by the terrible earthquake has raised questions about the future of the nuclear energy industry. Arjun is president of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research in the United States. He says the disaster in Japan is historic. This week, the chairman of America's nuclear agency said there is little chance that harmful radiation  from Japan could reach the United States. Gregory also said America has a strong program in place to deal with earthquake threats. No new nuclear power centers have been built in the United States since 1979. That was when America's worst nuclear accident happened at the Three Mile Island center in Pennsylvania. The accident began to turn public opinion against nuclear energy. At present, about twenty percent of electricity in the United States comes from nuclear energy. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany would close seven nuclear power centers for the time being while energy policy is reconsidered. The European Union is planning to test all centers in its twenty-seven member nations. Developing nations are less willing to slow down the development of nuclear. China says it will continue with plans to build about twenty-five new nuclear reactors . And India, under a cooperation agreement with the United States, plans to spend billions on new centers in the coming years. Nuclear reactors supply fourteen percent of global electricity. Nuclear energy is a clean resource, producing no carbon gases. But radioactive waste is a serious problem to be solved. So is the presence of nuclear power centers in earthquake areas like the one near Bushehr, lran. How does the author seem to feel about the future of nuclear energy?"

"Over the holidays, I took my three young children into a fancy chocolate shop to buy a gift. I was feeling pretty good until halfway home when I looked in the rearview mirror and noticed my 7-year-old son playing with a plastic toy. ""Um, where did you get that, Alex?!"" ""Did you buy it?"" ""Did I buy it?"" ""Did you take it?!"" Long story short: He had stolen the toy. I kept my cool--even when he said, ""but it was only a $1.50, mom!""--and explained why it was unacceptable to take things we didn't buy. I also said he would be returning to the store to apologize and return the item. A few hours later, I marched my son back to the store with two dollars from his pocket money. I stood by the door as he walked sheepishly to the counter and told the clerk that he had taken something without paying for it, that he was sorry and that he would pay for it now. (The toy could not be returned now because Alex had broken it.) Tears streamed down my cheeks as I watched him fidget nervously and search the clerk's face for a sign of approval. Fortunately, the clerk at the chocolate shop was gracious. She told my son he had done the right thing and when she caught my eye, I smiled in thanks and we left. I told my son that I was proud of him and to remember how awful the experience felt. What did the clerk do after Alex asked to pay for the toy?"

The key to staying safe on the Internet is to make sure that your profile is secure.The simplest way is to change the privacy setting on your profile to ""private"", which protects your information so that only the people on your friend list can view it.Although this is effective,it is not perfect.Predators can find ways to view your profile if they really want to,whether through hacking in or figuring out their way onto your friend list.Thus,you should never post too much personal information.Some people actually post their home and school addresses,date of birth,and other personal information, often letting predators know exactly where they will be and when.The most information that is safe is your first name and province.Anything more is basically inviting a predator into your life. Another big issue is photos. I suggest completely skipping photos and never posting a photo of a friend online without asking permission. Most importantly, never,under any circumstances,agree to a real-life meeting with anyone you meet online.No matter how well you think you know this person, there are no guarantees that they have told the truth.But you could feel free to chat with people you meet on the site, but just remember that not everyone is who they say they are.Hopefully,the next time you edit your profile,you'll be more informed about the dangers of internet predators and take the steps to defend yourself.

"As an American artist and writer of children's books, Tasha Tudor's art and nineteenth-century lifestyle have fascinated adults and children for decades. She received many awards and honors for her contributions to children's literature. When people talk about her creativity in artwork, she said, ""I do it to support my dogs and my four children."" Her great publishing record, the number of magazine stories that have been written about her over the years, and her admirers have no effects on her at all. Much of Tasha's artwork and her reading are done in the wintertime. ""I love winter. It's delightful,"" she says. ""I don't have to go anywhere because I work at home. If I'm snowed in, I can stay this way for months."" She hopes for early, deep snow to protect her garden from the hardship of the New England winter, and when it comes she puts on snowshoes when she needs to get down the mile-long dirt path that leads to the road. Given her enjoyment of winter and her fantasy way of life, it's not surprising that Tasha's Christmas is a storybook holiday. She hangs flowers over the front door. Her tree comes from the woods, and it goes up on Christmas Eve, lit by homemade candles and decorated with her great- grandmother's collection that dates from 1850. In a place of honor on the tree are large cookies cut into the shapes of her animals. The grandchildren and friends get presents from Tasha's old dolls; so do the animals and they have their own Christmas tree. ""Of course, it's a known fact that all the animals talk on Christmas Eve,"" she has written. Small, handmade gifts fill a big wooden box. At the end of each year, Tasha can look back and know that her life is perfect, that she has again ignored the twentieth century, and that the magic continues. And for the rest of us,here's a bit of advice, Tasha style: ""Nowadays, people are so restless. If they took some tea and spent more time rocking on the porch  in the evening listening to light music, they might enjoy life more."" In which section of a paper can you probably read the article?"
"Sam, a dog, was left behind in Colorado while his owners, Mr. And Mrs. Green moved to Southern California. They did not give the dog up. They found him a very nice home before they moved. They would have let Sam accompany them, but they were afraid the dog's presence would make it difficult for them to rent a house when they reached their _ . The Green family lived in Colorado for less than a year. Before that, they had lived in the same neighborhood in California to which they returned. So Sam had been there before, but only for a short time when he was young. Several months after the Greens left Colorado, after they were comfortably settled back in California, they heard a scratch at the door. They couldn't imagine who might be there. It never occurred to them that it might be Sam, because they were sure he was happily set up with his new family back in Colorado. When they opened the door, the Greens saw a dirty, tired dog with very hurting feet. The animal looked a little bit like Sam, but no one could believe that Sam could have walked 840 miles on his own. The tired dog spent the night under the family car. The next day, when he was more rested, he performed some of his old tricks. The Greens knew they had their own dog back. The Greens knew the dog was Sam   _  ."
"If you were on the street in Mexico today you might think you were in an operating room, surrounded by doctors. You could see many concerned people with masks   trying their best to stop the swine flu  . And the masks aren't only being used in Mexico. A friend of mine traveling from New York City to Florida was given a mask and a pair of gloves just after he reached the airport. And another friend went to get a haircut only to be faced with a hairdresser wearing a mask! But do the masks really work? Is covering your nose and mouth the key to stopping the swine flu? To find out the truth, ABC's reporter Sharyn Alfonsi talked with germ   expert Dr. Elaine Larsen. It turns out that when you sneeze   the air coming out of your mouth at a speed of one hundred miles per hour carries germs which can travel anywhere around you and make people around you infected  . However, whether you become infected actually depends on the weather. As Sharyn reported, when you sneeze, the germs leave your body in small drops of water coming out of your mouth. If the weather is wet, the wet air will make the small drops bigger and heavier and they drop down towards our feet. If this happens, we won't become infected. But if the air is dry, those small drops can float higher up, making it possible for them to touch someone else's nose, mouth or their mask. Larsen says the masks can stop the germs well but after a few hours, they start to get wet, holding a lot of germs they come across and causing you to breathe them in. The masks do work, but the key to stopping the germs is changing your masks often. According to Para.1, in Mexico you can see that   _  ."

"As long as you have broadband  service in your home, you can turn on your desktop computer and connect to the Internet. If you have a wireless router , a device that spreads the broadband connection to other devices, you can set up a Wi-Fi network, which enables your cellphones and tablets go online too. And when you are outdoors where is no Wi-Fi, such as in the park or at the beach, having 3G service allows you to stay connected. It seems that lots of us have Internet coverage everywhere we go. So why have mobile companies around the world lately been so enthusiastic about a new term, ""4G""? First, you need to know that the letter :G"" stands for ""generation"". Even if you have no idea what 4G is, at least you can figure out that it is a step up from 3G since it's the latest generation of mobile internet service. Unlike broadband, mobile Internet uses the same signal towers that provide voice service to your cellphone, which means wherever you can make phone calls with your cellphone you also have an Internet connection. But mobile connections have their _ : they don't carry as much information as broadband does, making opening websites and downloading music slower than they are on a Wi-Fi connection. This is why mobile connections have been constantly upgraded since the first generation was launched back in the 1980s. According to BBC, 4G is five to seven times faster than current 3G network speeds, almost as fast as home broadband. Because of this, 4G is widely suited for services like video downloading, mapping, online shopping and even video conferencing. To achieve the high speeds, network companies have to spend a lot of money on building new signal towers, which will eventually lead to a higher phone bill if you switch to 4G, and you will also have to get a new phone with 4G capacity. What does the author think of 4G service?"
"The day began with clear sunlight and blue skies.It soon turned into years of war, economic breakdown and political division. Ten years after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11,2001, America has come out of the smoke a very different country.Nearly 3,000 people died on September 11. Suddenly America had to wake up to the fact that not everyone loves the USS              A.Members of al-Qaeda, the militant group that earned out the attacks, were angry about US support for the Israelis against Palestinians in the Middle East, about US troops in Saudi Arabia, and about sanctions   against Iraq. ""September 11 and the years that followed were a shock to our national consciousness,"" said Nicholas Bums, American ambassador to NATO   at the time.The terrorists struck not only the buildings, but also Americans- faith in their power.The fear that America had lost control of events as widespread. In the name of fighting terrorism, the US launched wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.More than 6,000 Americans have died.Tens of thousands of ordinary people in those countries have also lost their lives. But deaths are only part of the story.The world was shocked by photographs of Americans torturing   Iraqis in Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad.David Goldstein, a reporter with The Kansas City Star, questioned American behavior: ""Has torturing so-called terrorists saved American lives or made the values we advocate around the world weaker? ..."" Is that what we've become?"" However, a brief moment of national unity did occur straight after 9/11.""Americans were coming together in an unusually powerful way ...in the ashes.We live in a bittersweet memory of that collective tragedy and collective possibility,"" said filmmaker Ken Burns. September 11 was that kind of common moment.When it was over, the Harth still turned in its usual way and the stars in the sky shone as before.But the universe had shifted somehow. Though the world felt the consequence of September 11, more is to come.Ten years on, it still might be too soon to tell. What can be inferred from the passage?"
"A captain of a boat lost his way in the middle of a storm. While trying to control the ship and avoid sinking, he started feeling annoyed. The water became bigger; the noise of the water hitting the boat, like a feather carried by the wind, almost led him to hopelessness. But he did not give up and tried harder every time the waves hit the boat. In his desperate attempts to stay strong and keep the boat steady, he was unable to hear one of his crew officers yelling at him. ""Captain, Captain!"" kept yelling the officer. He held on to one of the deck's bars in order not to fall off the boat, ""Captain, Captain!"" insisted the officer. This time, while the officer was trying to approach him, a huge wave almost made the boat turn over and he fell and rolled on the deck till he luckily found another bar to hold on to. After several attempts, the officer finally was able to reach his fighting and tired captain, who had started to yell out his frustration and thoughts to the angry waves. ""If I am a good and hard-working man, why does this happen to me? And why can't I get out of this one? I have been sailing the open ocean for years to fish the best catch and get support for my family!! Why, why, why?!!!"" At that moment, his crew officer was able to catch the captain's shoulder and make him turn so that the captain could hear him. ""Captain, Captain!"" yelled again the officer. The captain looked at him angrily because the officer distracted him from his difficult task. ""What do you need, officer? Don't you see I am trying to control the ship and find our way back?"" complained the captain. His officer kept holding on to the captain and pointed at the opposite direction, towards the stern  .  ""Captain!"" he replied. ""The lighthouse is right over there, on the other side. We are going in the wrong direction!!"" Why was the captain angry with his crew officer?"
"The first day my new teacher walked into our school in Spanish Harlem, I burst out laughing. Ron Clark was a young white guy from North Carolina who talked with a funny Southern accent . He said he used to be a singing waiter. I thought, who is this guy? He's a complete joke.  It was 1999 and I was in the fifth grade at New York City's P.S. 83.  _ . I'd always been a troublemaker. I'd get yelled at, and then the teachers would give up on me. I thought that's what would happen with Ron Clark. I was wrong. That first week, I kept mocking him. He pulled me out to the hallway and said I'd better shape up. ""Tamara,"" he said, ""you're a smart kid. You can do better."" He told me I was a natural leader and that I'd go far in life if I started applying myself. I was mad at first, but then something happened: I began to respect him. There were 29 students in our class, and it didn't take long for us to realize that Ron Clark was no ordinary teacher.  He was only 27 and had the most unusual way of teaching. To help us learn the states and capitals, he changed the lyrics of a popular rap hit called ""Thong Song"" and had us sing and dance with him. When we read the Harry Potter books, he decorated  our classroom like Hogwarts. And during the Presidential election, he put campaign posters on the walls and covered the room with 5,000 red, white and blue stars. What's the author's attitude toward the new teacher on the first day?"
"People often talk as if shyness is a disease or mental condition that can be cured. I prefer to think of it as an emotional disability. It's something we are born with and something we carry with us in our entire lives. There are too many people, however, who seem to be determined to find some way of doing away with their shyness. In my opinion, it's a waste of time. I don't mean that we should do nothing about it; quite the contrary, I think we need to separate the basic fact of our shyness from our ability to take part in a social environment. Look at one of the most famous shy people of them all, Johnny Carson. This man is painfully shy, yet for decades he made a living talking and associating with different people every night, in front of a national audience. Carson has never done away with his shyness, but he has successfully found a way to deal with it to the extent that he could be, not just a talk show host, but a legend among talk show hosts. Look also at Sally Fields, who has recently admitted her problem with shyness. This is a woman who has appeared in many films, TV shows and interviews, yet in her early years she was so shy that she turned down a lunch invitation from Jane Fonda because she was terribly afraid of meeting her. I guess that our shyness is there because each of us is born with some insecurity and this insecurity prevents us from reaching out to others the way people with a more open personality do. As we grow up and become adults, we allow our social skills to grow and develop. But we are still stuck in kindergarten or elementary school or wherever it was when our shyness took root in our soul. The author thinks that our shyness is there because  _  ."
